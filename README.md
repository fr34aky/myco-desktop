# Myco Desktop

**This repo is [Myco](https://github.com/Origami74/myco) plus its desktop
app** — a Linux-first Tauri shell in [`desktop/`](desktop/) that mirrors the
Android feature set: the Apps grid with each nsite in its own chrome-less
window, Circle + QR pairing, mesh file sharing with consent, Discover,
Settings, and the Dev diagnostics. It links `myco-core` directly (no FFI) and
runs against a system fips daemon when one answers, or embeds its own node —
BLE, LAN UDP, and its own `fips0` TUN — when none does. Design:
[`docs/design/desktop.md`](docs/design/desktop.md).

Build (Linux, glibc): the workspace needs a local
[fips](https://github.com/k0sti/fips) checkout at `reference/fips` (a
gitignored path dependency — see [`docs/how-to/build.md`](docs/how-to/build.md)
§4) plus the webkit2gtk/gtk3 dev packages, then:

```sh
cargo build -p myco-desktop
./target/debug/myco-desktop
# embedded mode only, one-time (and after each rebuild):
sudo desktop/packaging/myco-setup ./target/debug/myco-desktop
```

The original Android README follows.

Myco is a peer-to-peer app-sharing network. Meet someone, **pair** with a quick
QR scan, and their apps land in your **Library**, ready to use offline. Pairing
always goes both ways: the code you scan carries a one-time invite, so the moment
you connect, apps can flow in either direction between you. Anything you install
you can pass on to the next person — so apps spread from phone to phone, on their
own, with no servers and no single point that has to stay online.

![How apps spread](docs/design/diagrams/intro-03-how-it-spreads.svg)

The apps you collect get their own home-screen icons, and each one opens
full-screen as its own app:

![Every app gets its own window](docs/design/diagrams/intro-05-each-its-own-app.svg)

## How it works (for developers)

Under the hood, an "app" is an **nsite** — a static web app published on Nostr.
**Installing** an app means syncing and caching its author-signed files so it
runs offline; **passing it on** is your device re-serving those same signed files
to the next person. Apps travel over a **FIPS** mesh — including fully offline
over **Bluetooth (L2CAP)** — with an embedded Nostr relay + Blossom server on
each device. The reusable content layer (relay + Blossom + gateway + sync) lives
in a standalone `nsite-deck` crate; the Myco app crate `myco-core` wires it to
FIPS, BLE, and the Android shell.

Full design docs are in **[docs/](docs/README.md)**:

- [Deep links](docs/design/deep-links.md) — linking to a place inside an app, and what happens when that app isn't installed yet
- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)

## Status

**Design phase — not yet built.** This repository currently holds the design
docs and diagrams. The v1 target is a two-device Android demo over Bluetooth,
fully offline — one phone browses an app installed from the other. See the
[roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

> Built on [nostr-vpn](https://github.com/mmalmi/nostr-vpn) (FIPS data plane),
> reusing the [FIPS](https://github.com/k0sti/fips) mesh, and reimplementing the
> nsite-deck content layer in Rust.
