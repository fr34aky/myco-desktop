# Nostr Event Kinds Reference

The Nostr event kinds Myco reads, stores, serves, and replicates. Myco
**never authors, signs, or publishes** nsite or napplet events — it holds and
re-emits events authored *elsewhere* (by external nsite and napplet tooling) and
the content-addressed blobs they reference. Three families:

1. **nsite content kinds** — the author-signed site manifests the
   gateway/relay/Blossom layer serves and propagates (kinds `15128`, `35128`).
   These are *established facts*, verified from the nsite protocol and the
   reference implementation.
2. **napplet manifest kinds** — the same manifest shape at kinds `5129` /
   `15129` / `35129` under NIP-5D, plus the tags that make a napplet a program
   rather than a document. Read by `myco-napplet-runtime`.
3. **FIPS discovery kinds** — used by `fips-core` for *future* public-node
   peering over the internet (kinds `37195`, `21059`, `10050`). Not needed for
   the offline BLE demo; documented here so the surface is complete.

Design context: [../design/nsite/nsite-layer.md](../design/nsite/nsite-layer.md),
[../design/nsite/propagation.md](../design/nsite/propagation.md). Protocol sources are
cited inline.

## nsite content kinds

Source of truth:
the nsite-deck reference (`docs/nsite-protocol.md`)
(NIP-5A, "Pubkey Static Websites"), and the reference implementation in
the nsite-deck reference (`internal/sync/service.go`)
and the nsite-deck reference (`internal/gateway/handlers.go`).

### Kind 15128 — root-site manifest

- **Class:** replaceable. Exactly one per pubkey — the pubkey's root site.
- **`d` tag:** MUST NOT be present.
- **Content:** empty.
- **URL host:** `npub1…` (NIP-19 bech32 of the author pubkey).

### Kind 35128 — named-site manifest

- **Class:** parameterized-replaceable. One per `(pubkey, d-tag)` — a named
  sub-site under the pubkey ("like a sub-domain").
- **`d` tag:** REQUIRED — the site identifier. For a canonical URL the d-tag
  MUST match `^[a-z0-9-]{1,13}$` and MUST NOT end with `-` (so 50-char
  `pubkeyB36` + ≤13-char d-tag fits one 63-char DNS label).
- **Content:** empty.
- **URL host:** `<pubkeyB36><dTag>` — the 50-char lowercase-base36 pubkey
  directly followed by the d-tag, no separator. Encoder/decoder + regex:
  the nsite-deck reference (`internal/gateway/base36.go`).

### Tag layout (both kinds)

| Tag | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `["d", "<identifier>"]` | 35128 only | Site identifier (the named-site d-tag). Absent on 15128. |
| `["path", "/abs/path.ext", "<sha256>"]` | yes (≥1) | Maps one absolute file path to the sha256 of its bytes (a Blossom blob). |
| `["server", "<blossom-url>"]` | no | Hint: a Blossom server that may hold the blobs. Online fallback only — ignored on the offline `.fips` path. |
| `["title", "<text>"]` | no | Human-readable site title (shown in Library / loading page). |
| `["description", "<text>"]` | no | Short site description. |
| `["source", "<http-url>"]` | no | Link to the site's source repo/archive. |
| `["x", "<hex>", "aggregate"]` | no | The NIP-5A **aggregate hash** over the `path` tags — one content address for the whole file set. |

#### The aggregate hash

`sha256` of the `path` tags rendered as `"<sha256> <abs-path>\n"` lines, sorted
ascending and concatenated as UTF-8, lowercase hex. Only `path` tags feed it.

Hash-checking each blob proves no file is corrupt. Only the aggregate proves the
set is *whole* — that what is served is the site its author signed, with nothing
removed by a re-signing intermediary.

Myco verifies it in `nsite_deck::aggregate`. For an **nsite**, a manifest whose
aggregate disagrees with its own `path` tags is logged and served on its
per-blob hashes, with no verified aggregate recorded — a warning, not a refusal,
until the formula has been checked against enough published sites to take one
off the air on its say-so. A manifest with **no** aggregate tag is accepted:
most published nsites predate the tag and every blob is individually
hash-verified anyway. **Napplets** are strict: a mismatch is refused, because
the recomputed value is their identity — see below.

The site icon is conventionally the blob mapped at `/favicon.ico`. A custom
not-found page is the blob mapped at `/404.html`.

### Worked example — root site (kind 15128)

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 15128,
  "pubkey": "266815e0c9210dfa324c6cba3573b14bee49da4209a9456f9484e5106cd408a5",
  "created_at": 1727373475,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["path", "/index.html",  "186ea5fd14e88fd1ac49351759e7ab906fa94892002b60bf7f5a428f28ca1c99"],
    ["path", "/about.html",  "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456"],
    ["path", "/favicon.ico", "fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321"],
    ["title", "My Nostr Site"],
    ["description", "A static website hosted on Nostr"]
  ],
  "id": "…",
  "sig": "…"
}
```

### Worked example — named site (kind 35128)

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 35128,
  "pubkey": "266815e0c9210dfa324c6cba3573b14bee49da4209a9456f9484e5106cd408a5",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "blog"],
    ["path", "/index.html", "186ea5fd14e88fd1ac49351759e7ab906fa94892002b60bf7f5a428f28ca1c99"],
    ["path", "/post.html",  "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456"],
    ["title", "My Blog"]
  ],
  "id": "…",
  "sig": "…"
}
```

### Query filters Myco uses

```jsonc
// root manifest
{ "kinds": [15128], "authors": ["<pubkey>"] }

// named manifest
{ "kinds": [35128], "authors": ["<pubkey>"], "#d": ["<identifier>"] }
```

These run against the **local** relay first (fast path) and, on a miss, against
the source peer's relay over `.fips` (`ws://<npub>.fips:4870`). See
[../design/nsite/nsite-layer.md §5](../design/nsite/nsite-layer.md).

> **Set reconciliation.** Between two connected relays, Myco reconciles the
> manifest **event** set with **negentropy ([NIP-77](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/77.md))**
> run over these same filters (`NEG-OPEN` → `NEG-MSG` rounds → the missing ids),
> then pulls only the diff. Blobs are never reconciled — they stay content-addressed
> pull-by-sha256. See [../design/nsite/propagation.md §5](../design/nsite/propagation.md) and
> [../design/nsite/nsite-layer.md §2.4](../design/nsite/nsite-layer.md).

### Kind 34128 — legacy, NOT used

The original nsite design used kind `34128`: one event *per file*, with the path
in a `d` tag and the sha256 in an `x` tag. Myco does **not** read or write
it — Myco is manifest-based (one `15128`/`35128` event maps all paths).
Documented only so old `34128` events seen on a relay are recognized and
ignored. (Source: NIP-5A "Legacy Support".)

## napplet manifest kinds

Source of truth: [NIP-5D](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/2303) and
the [NAP registry](https://github.com/napplet/naps). Design:
[../design/napplet/napplet-runtime.md](../design/napplet/napplet-runtime.md).

A napplet manifest is a NIP-5A manifest — same `path` / `server` / `title` / `d`
layout — at three different kinds:

| Kind | Class | Meaning |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| `5129` | Regular | Snapshot: an immutable point-in-time release. |
| `15129` | Replaceable | Root: an author's latest unnamed napplet. No `d` tag. |
| `35129` | Param-replaceable | Named: carries a `d` tag identifier. |

> **Not 35128.** The NAP registry README calls a napplet "a NIP-5A manifest, a
> Nostr event, kind 35128". That names the parent spec and the parent's kind.
> `35128` is Myco's **nsite** kind; napplets are `5129` / `15129` / `35129`.
> Worth a one-line correction upstream.

### Added tags

| Tag | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `["x", "<hex>", "aggregate"]` | no | Corroborates the aggregate. The runtime **recomputes** the napplet's identity from the `path` tags either way; when the tag is present it must match. |
| `["requires", "<domain>"]` | no | A NAP capability domain the napplet needs (`relay`, `identity`, `storage`). Shown on the install review screen; grants are recorded per library entry. |
| `["archetype", "<slug>", "<convention>"]` | no | A role the napplet can be invoked as. The convention is a queryless `napplet:<archetype>/<intent>` identity — NAP-INTENT routes on exact equality over it. |
| `["config", "<json-schema>"]` | no | Declarative per-napplet configuration. |

**None of the added tags feed the aggregate.** Only `path` tags do. A runtime
that hashed `requires`, `archetype` or `config` would reject every conformant
napplet in existence.

### Identity and the single-file rule

A napplet's identity is the `(dTag, aggregateHash)` tuple **computed** by the
runtime from verified bytes. The napplet never asserts it, and no host or
gateway supplies it. An `x` tag, when carried, is checked against the computed
value; it is not the source of it.

Napplets are **single-file** — NIP-5D: *"A napplet is a single self-contained
`/index.html`."* The runtime injects those bytes as `iframe.srcdoc` under
`sandbox="allow-scripts"` with no `allow-same-origin`, so the document has an
opaque origin with nowhere to resolve a relative subresource to. A manifest
listing more than one file is not a napplet and is rejected at parse, rather than
inlined at runtime — inlining would assemble bytes the author never signed as a
unit.

---

> **Note on online-fallback kinds.** When *online*, the sync engine may consult
> the author's `10002` (NIP-65 relay list) and `10063`
> ([BUD-03](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/03.md) user
> Blossom servers) to find public sources, exactly as the Go reference does
> (`service.go`). On the
> **offline** BLE path these are irrelevant — the source is a single reachable
> peer's `.fips` services.

---

## Propagation: the manifest event *is* the propagated unit

There is **no** net-new announcement kind. The hybrid propagation default —
**announce widely, pull content on demand** — is built entirely on the
author-signed manifests above:

- **The flooded unit is the author-signed manifest itself** (kind `15128` /
  `35128`). It is small, self-authenticating (the author's signature travels
  with it), and re-emitted **unmodified** by relays — replicating an existing
  author-signed event relay-to-relay is ordinary relay behaviour, **not**
  authoring. Because the bytes are unchanged, the author's signature stays
  valid. A holder re-emitting an author's manifest needs **no new kind and no
  holder signature**.
- **"Announce widely"** = flood/replicate those manifest events across reachable
  relays, with a hop budget of **TTL = 5** (a project default).
- **"Pull on demand"** = fetch the large content-addressed **blobs** (by sha256
  from Blossom) only when a site is actually opened — the manifest tells you
  *what* a site is; the blobs are deferred until needed.
- **Discovery / "nsites around me"** = simply the set of manifests you have
  *received* (via flood) or *queried* from reachable relays. No separate "I have
  it" event exists; possession of the manifest is the advertisement.

Loop-suppression and dedup during the flood are done over the **manifest events
themselves** — 16-byte SHA-256 IDs in a per-node seen-set — while steady-state
catch-up between connected relays uses **negentropy (NIP-77)** reconciliation so a
peer offers only manifests you lack (events only; blobs stay pull-by-sha256). TTL=5,
that dedup story, transitive peer discovery, and the privacy question of *which
manifests you choose to replicate* are all detailed in
[../design/nsite/propagation.md](../design/nsite/propagation.md).

## Pairing and file-sharing kinds (layer 2)

Layer 2 has its own small vocabulary, all signed by the **device key** and
carried point-to-point, never gossiped:

| Kind | Name | Carried how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `9101` | pair request — carries the one-time secret from the presented code and the sender's name | HTTP POST to `<npub>.fips:4873/pair`, Noise-encrypted to the presenter |
| `9102` | pair accept — the presenter's answer, so the requester adds them back | the same service on the requester |
| `9103` | pair remove — forgetting a peer tells them, so both sides stay symmetric | the same service |
| `1059` (wrapping `13` wrapping `14`) | file offer / accept / decline / cancel / done, as NIP-17 private messages | the peer's relay over the mesh; the wrap keeps them unreadable to anyone else, and the hub stores them with a zero hop budget so they travel no further |

Design: [identity-pairing.md](../design/core/identity-pairing.md) §6–7,
`file_transfer.rs`.

## Napplet-published kinds (layer 1)

Signed by the **user key**, on the first napplet run: a `0` guest profile named
`Myco Guest <5 digits>` and a `10002` relay list naming this phone's mesh relay
(`ws://<npub>.fips:4870`) first and the configured public relays after it. Both
go to the local relay only. Whatever a napplet publishes through `relay`,
`outbox` or `mesh` is signed by the same key with the kind the napplet chose.

## FIPS discovery kinds (future public-node peering)

These are `fips-core`'s own Nostr event kinds, used to find and rendezvous with
peers **over the public internet** (NAT traversal, overlay adverts). They are
**not** used in the v1 offline BLE demo — BLE peering is QR + adverts, not Nostr.
They are listed so the full Nostr surface Myco *could* touch is documented,
and so their numbers are not accidentally reused for nsite kinds.

Verified from
[../../reference/fips/docs/reference/nostr-events.md](../../reference/fips/docs/reference/nostr-events.md).
All three are signed with the node's FIPS identity key (the same secp256k1
keypair Nostr uses — there is no separate Nostr key).

| Kind | Name | Class | Encryption | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ---------- | ------- |
| `37195` | Overlay advert | Param-replaceable (`d`=`fips-overlay-v1`) | Signed only | Publish a node's reachable transport endpoints (UDP/TCP/Tor, or `nat`). |
| `21059` | Traversal signaling | Ephemeral (20000–29999) | NIP-44 inside NIP-59 gift wrap | Carry `TraversalOffer` / `TraversalAnswer` during a UDP NAT hole-punch. |
| `10050` | NIP-17 inbox relay list | Replaceable | Signed only | Tell dialers which relays to send gift-wrapped traversal offers to. |

Notes:

- **`37195`** sits in the parameterized-replaceable range; its digits visually
  spell **FIPS** (7=F, 1=I, 9=P, 5=S). Its `d` tag is the fixed literal
  `fips-overlay-v1`; content is an `OverlayAdvert` JSON document
  (`endpoints`, optional `signalRelays`, `stunServers`). NIP-40 `expiration`
  (default 3600s) ages adverts out.
- **`21059`** is the NIP-59 gift-wrap outer kind; the inner seal is a kind-13
  event and the rumor is the actual offer/answer. Ephemeral → conforming relays
  do not store it.
- **`10050`** is standard NIP-17 (DM inbox relays), distinct from `10002`
  (NIP-65 general read/write relays). FIPS publishes its own `10050` on startup
  so dialers know where to deliver `21059` offers.
