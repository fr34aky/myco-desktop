# Identity & pairing

This doc covers how Myco establishes a device identity and how two phones
become **Circle members** of each other. There is **no network, no roster, no
admin**: a pairing is two people's mutual, signed decision, stored on both
phones, and it is what admits each to the other's relay and store. Everything
downstream (mesh address, where to fetch, who to poll) derives
deterministically from the paired npub. What a pairing *means* — and why it is
not the same as a FIPS peer link — is [../circle/circle.md](../circle/circle.md).

## 1. One device identity = three derived forms

Myco reuses the FIPS unification: a single Nostr keypair is the **device
identity**. There is exactly one secret to guard, and three public forms derive
from it. None of the public forms is stored as ground truth — all are recomputed
from the key.

This device key is **never used to author nsites.** It identifies *this device*
on the mesh, authenticates BLE links, and addresses this device's own
relay + Blossom. nsite *author* identities are entirely separate external keys
(see §1.1); the device holds and serves authors' signed events but never holds
an author's secret key and never signs on an author's behalf.

| Form | Derivation | Used as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **npub** (`npub1…`) | bech32 of the 32-byte x-only pubkey | device identity in QR/UI; host of *this device's* relay + Blossom (`<npub>.fips`) |
| **node_addr** (16 bytes) | `SHA256(npub)[0:16]` | mesh routing address |
| **ULA IPv6** (`fd00::/8`) | `fd` ‖ `node_addr[0:15]` | what `<npub>.fips` resolves to (AAAA) |

This chain is established in
[fips-architecture.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-architecture.md) and
[fips-ipv6-adapter.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-ipv6-adapter.md).
The load-bearing consequence for pairing: **once you have a peer's device npub,
you can compute where they live on the mesh with no further exchange.** No
directory, no lookup, no signed announcement. Scanning a QR that carries a device
npub is sufficient to address that peer's services at `<npub>.fips:4870` (relay)
and `<npub>.fips:24243` (Blossom), via the local DNS interceptor
([fips-ipv6-adapter.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-ipv6-adapter.md)).

### 1.1 Device identity vs. nsite author identity (do not conflate)

These are two different kinds of key and they never overlap:

- **Device identity** — the device's one Nostr keypair (this section). It is the
  FIPS mesh address, the BLE link credential, and the host of *this device's*
  relay + Blossom (`<npub_device>.fips`). It is **never** used to author nsites.
- **nsite author identity** — *external* keys belonging to whoever authored a
  site, created by external nsite tooling elsewhere. An author key appears here
  **only** as the URL host of a requested site (`<npub_author>.localhost`) and as the
  `authors` filter in relay queries. The app holds and serves an author's signed
  events but never holds their secret key and never signs on their behalf.

The practical consequence: **the site you want and the peer you fetch it from are
different keys.** A site is identified by its *author* npub; the peer holding a
copy is a *holder*, reached at `<npub_holder>.fips`. To pull a held site you query
that holder's relay with `{kinds:[15128 or 35128], authors:[<author_pubkey>]}` —
the holder's device key addresses the relay, the author key selects the events.

## 2. Identity storage

The secret key (`identity.nsec`) is generated on first launch and persisted in
the app's private `filesDir`, owned by the Rust core (`identity_store.rs`) and
never surfaced to a WebView.

- **Generation:** on first run the core generates a fresh keypair if no key file
  exists; the Android side hands the core a data-dir path and the core owns
  what lives there ([settings.md](../../reference/settings.md)).
- **Scope:** `filesDir` is app-private storage on Android, not world-readable.
  Whether to additionally wrap the key with the Android Keystore / a
  user-supplied passphrase is an open question deferred to
  [security.md](./security.md).
- **No export in v1:** there is no UI to display or copy the `nsec`. Backup /
  key portability is **TBD / open**.

## 3. One identity per device (default)

**Proposed default:** one identity per device in v1. The app does not present an
account picker; the single on-disk key *is* the user.

- Simplifies the FIPS endpoint (one node_addr, one ULA, one advertised service
  UUID), the QR (one npub to show), and the BLE handshake (one pubkey to send in
  the `[0x00][pubkey:32]` pre-handshake exchange —
  [ble/io.rs](../../../reference/fips/src/transport/ble/io.rs)).
- **Multi-persona is a later milestone.** When added, each persona is an
  independent keypair → independent node_addr/ULA → independent Library and source
  set. Personas would not share collected peers by default. Open question:
  whether the FIPS endpoint can host multiple node identities concurrently on
  one BLE radio, or whether persona switching tears down and rebuilds the
  endpoint. **TBD / open.**

## 4. QR pairing

### 4.1 The scanner and the deep-link path

- **Camera scanner.** A ZXing-based scan screen (`PortraitCaptureActivity`)
  with a single-emit guard and a prefix check on the payload; a scan of anything
  but a `myco://` code is rejected with "Not a Myco code" and scanning
  continues.
- **Deep-link intent.** `MainActivity` handles `myco://` in `onCreate` and
  `onNewIntent`, so a link opened from anywhere — a chat, an NFC tag, another
  app — reaches the same add-peer code path as a scanned QR
  (`share/MycoLink.kt`).

### 4.2 Our payload: `myco://pair/<base64>`

**Proposed default payload:**

```
myco://pair/<base64(JSON)>
```

where the JSON carries:

```json
{ "npub": "npub1…", "name": "green sammy", "pairSecret": "…" }
```

The **memorable name** is a human handle for this device — a colour + name like
`green sammy` or `blue james`, suggested automatically when you generate your code
(and editable). It's carried in the QR so peers recognise you by it in their
**Library** and **circle**, and because it's something you can say out loud, it
doubles as a quick check that you paired with the right person. It grants no
authority.

The **`pairSecret`** is a **long, high-entropy random string** (≈256 bits) — a
**single-use** bearer token (see §6.1). It authenticates the mandatory pairing
handshake — proving the peer actually scanned *this* invite — but is itself **not**
a membership or authorization token. Its unguessable length is the whole defence:
there is no key-exchange ceremony, just **echo-and-match** over the already-encrypted
mesh channel (§6.1). The `base64`
is URL-safe, unpadded.

Crucially, the payload carries **no MAC and no PSM**. Those are radio-layer
details that are (a) volatile (Android MAC randomization) and (b) not needed for
addressing — FIPS identifies a peer by the pubkey it sends during the BLE
pre-handshake, not by MAC, and the listener PSM is learned from BLE adverts at
connect time (see BLE doc / [propagation.md](../nsite/propagation.md)). The QR is a
*stable, transport-independent* identity; the radio details come over the air.

Validation on scan is a prefix check — `myco://pair/` (or `myco://share/`,
`myco://app/`, `myco://napplet/`) — and anything else is rejected.

### 4.3 What the payload deliberately is not

It is a **peer card**, not a network invite: no network id, no admin list, no
roster, no relay hints. The `pairSecret` proves the peer saw *this* invite; it
grants no membership and no authority. Endpoints derive from the npub
(`<npub>.fips`), so nothing else needs to be carried.

## 5. Peer as data source

When you scan a peer's `myco://pair/<base64>` (or open the deep link), the app:

1. Decodes and validates the npub, memorable name, and `pairSecret`.
2. Derives `node_addr` and the `fd00::` ULA from the npub (§1) — no network call.
3. **Initiates the mandatory handshake** against the inviter's on-device pairing
   endpoint — `POST http://<npub>.fips:4873/pair` (§6.1): echoes `pairSecret` back
   over that Noise-encrypted channel, the inviter matches it and confirms.
4. On a completed handshake, adds two sources to your source set, addressed
   deterministically:
   - relay at `<npub>.fips:4870`
   - Blossom at `<npub>.fips:24243`
5. Stores the npub (and memorable name) in your **circle** (the local peer list).

Pairing is **handshake-mandatory and always mutual**: scanning is not a purely
local act — it initiates the secret-echo handshake against the inviter's on-device
`<npub>.fips` endpoint, and completion makes you a **mutual** source (each side
holds the other; see §6). **Both devices must be reachable at pairing time** —
they're physically together when the QR is scanned, so the BLE link is up.
Whether anything is actually reachable later is a liveness question resolved over
FIPS (live-path only; see [propagation.md](../nsite/propagation.md)).

Why this is safe without authorization: all content the peer serves is
**self-authenticating** — Nostr events are signed by their (external) author and
Blossom blobs are content-addressed by SHA-256
(`nsite-protocol.md` (nsite-deck reference)). A
malicious or impersonating source cannot forge an nsite whose *author* key it
doesn't hold, and cannot substitute blob content without changing the hash.
Re-serving an author's already-signed events is normal relay behaviour and does
not make the serving device the author. So "anyone can be a source" carries no
trust cost; verification happens at fetch/serve time, covered in
[security.md](./security.md).

> Learning an npub grants nothing on the peer's side by itself — it only
> configures *your* client to point at *their* always-derivable address. What
> grants the peer anything on *your* side is the mutual handshake (§6), which
> puts them in your Circle.

## 6. Mutual pairing and transitive authorization

Every pairing is **mutual** (§5): completing the handshake makes each side a
source for the other and additionally authorizes each side to **poll the other
for their collected peer list**, transitively widening reach (the right half of
[diagram 02](../diagrams/02-pairing-transitive-discovery.svg)).

A mutual pairing is formed by **invite-pairing with a one-time secret** (§6.1) —
**not** by both parties scanning each other. A single scan plus a
secret-authenticated round-trip over the mesh yields the mutual relationship, and
the secret is what *proves* the peer actually saw your invite. Invite-pairing is
**the** pairing method; there is no separate one-way, no-handshake mode.

### 6.1 Invite-pairing via a one-time secret

Modeled on **NIP-46 (Nostr Connect)** — a connection token carrying a one-time
secret plus a rendezvous, where the other side connects, authenticates with the
secret, and an ack completes the handshake. FIPS supplies the rendezvous (the
mesh), so no public relay is required.

1. **Invite token** (shown as a QR / link): `{npub_A, name, pairSecret}`.
   `<npub_A>.fips` is derivable from `npub_A` (§1), so the token carries no address.
   The `pairSecret` is a **long random string** (≈256 bits), **single-use**, and
   optionally **TTL-bounded**.
2. **B scans once** and posts to **A's pairing endpoint at
   `http://<npub_A>.fips:4873/pair`** — an **on-device** service, no third party
   (§6.2). That channel is already **Noise-XK encrypted and authenticated to A's
   device key** (§1), so B is talking to the real A in confidence. B simply
   **echoes the `pairSecret` back** over it, along with `{npub_B, name}`. No
   key-exchange protocol is needed: because the secret is a long random string,
   echoing it *inside the encrypted channel* reveals nothing to anyone else and
   cannot be guessed.
3. **A matches the secret** against the one it generated (single-use, not yet
   redeemed) and shows a **confirm prompt** — B's npub + memorable name — that A's
   user taps **OK** to accept. A then **acks** (+ A's memorable name), marks the
   secret consumed, and stores B in its circle — a **mutual** pairing from a
   **single** scan. Both sides now hold each other, so each may poll the other's
   peer list.

This is **stronger** than a bare trust-on-first-use scan (see
[security.md § 4](./security.md)): two things already hold the line — FIPS **Noise
XK** authenticates and encrypts the channel to `<npub_A>.fips` (no relay-MITM,
nothing on the wire to capture), and the **OK prompt** keeps a human in the loop to
confirm the memorable name. The long random `pairSecret` supplies the missing piece —
proof the peer actually scanned *this* invite (and anti-spam, since your npub is
public). Because the endpoint is on-device, invite-pairing works peer-to-peer /
offline — both sides must be reachable when B completes (an optional public
rendezvous for fully-async pairing is a possible later extension).

Once mutually paired:

- Alice can ask Ben "who are your peers?" and learn Carl and Dana. She then
  derives Carl's and Dana's `<npub>.fips` addresses (§1) and can fetch their
  nsites too — multi-hop over FIPS, with Ben as an intermediate hop on the live
  path.
- **The completed invite-pairing is the authorization.** Because every pairing is
  mutual, Ben answers Alice's peer-list poll precisely because they completed
  invite-pairing — a lightweight, symmetric consent that exists in v1. It is *not*
  an admin grant and confers no write access: Alice can read Ben's list of npubs,
  that is all.
- The shared data is a **list of npubs** (the cheapest possible currency:
  re-deriving everything else from each npub is free). No endpoints or membership
  tokens cross this poll.
- Transitive reach is **not transitive trust.** Content fetched from Carl via Ben
  is still verified by signature/hash at the consumer (§5). Ben cannot launder
  unsigned or tampered content through the poll; he can only *name* peers.

How the poll is carried, how often, scope/TTL, and whether Carl's content is
pulled eagerly or on demand are propagation concerns — see
[propagation.md](../nsite/propagation.md). Author-signed manifest events (kinds
15128 / 35128) flood with a default budget of 3 hops, while the large blobs stay
pull-only (fetched only when a site is opened).

### 6.2 Where the handshake lands: the auth service on `:4873`

#### Two checks before anything is acted on

A valid signature proves **who wrote** an event. It says nothing about who the
event was *for*, and nothing about whether we wanted it. Both gaps are checked
explicitly:

- **Addressed to us.** Every pair event names its target in a `p` tag. An event
  addressed to a third device verifies perfectly when replayed at us, so one
  captured off the wire would otherwise be usable against anyone.
- **An accept answers an invite.** A `pair-accept` is only honoured while a
  matching invite from us is outstanding, and an invite is spent once answered.
  Without this, anyone could sign an accept and add themselves to the Circle
  unprompted — which grants relay read/write, blob reads, and multihop
  forwarding by default.

Invites are persisted, so an accept that arrives after a restart is still
honoured, and expire after a week so an unanswered one does not remain a
standing authorisation. A refused event is answered `403`.


The handshake events and their signatures are unchanged. What changed is where
they stop.

**Before.** The three pairing kinds were published to the peer's **relay** port
as ordinary Nostr events. The relay's access gate whitelisted exactly those kinds
so an unpaired stranger could publish them and only them, and the event was
verified, written into the event store, and then handed to the pairing handler.
Storing it was incidental — nothing ever read those kinds back.

**Now.** Pairing terminates at its own small HTTP service:

```
POST http://<npub>.fips:4873/pair    body: a signed pair event (9101 / 9102 / 9103)
  → 200 {"status":"paired"}      an accept, processed — they are in our circle
  → 200 {"status":"unpaired"}    a remove, processed
  → 202 {"status":"pending"}     a request, waiting on the user
  → 403 {"status":"declined"}    bad signature, expired, or not a pairing event
  → 429 / 503                    rate limited or at capacity
```

One route, not three: the kind is already in the event. The payload stays a
signed Nostr event because the **signature is the pairing identity proof**.

#### What this buys

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **No stranger writes into the store** | Pairing events are never stored now. With a swappable relay behind us, an incidental write would have handed a stranger a write path into a store we do not own. |
| **The content ports have no exceptions** | `:4870` and `:24243` require circle membership, checked **before** the WebSocket upgrade. The relay refuses the pairing kinds from *every* source, paired or not. |
| **One unauthenticated surface** | `:4873` is the only port an unpaired device can reach, so hardening and rate limiting have a single address. |
| **Bootstrap survives a broken content plane** | Relay port taken, backend down or misconfigured — two phones can still pair, which is the one operation that could repair the situation. |
| **Honest acknowledgements** | HTTP status separates *delivered, waiting on them* from *never reached them*. The old retry loop re-sent 15 times because a relay `OK true` only meant "received"; a `202` now stops it. |

#### No tokens, no sessions

FIPS addresses are identity-derived and Noise-IK authenticated, so the mesh
address already **is** the authenticated npub. The service's only output is a
circle membership commit, which is exactly what the content gates read. A session
credential would be redundant crypto over an already-authenticated channel.

Membership is committed **before** the reply is sent, so a peer that dials the
relay the instant it sees a `200` is already admitted.

That reasoning stops holding if Myco ever gates a transport whose addresses are
not identity-bound. Worth noting; not worth building for.

#### Limits

An open port on a BLE-constrained radio needs its own bounds. In the lenient
spirit of [nsite-permissions.md](../nsite/nsite-permissions.md) — slow down rather than
hard-fail:

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Per-source token bucket | 1/s sustained, burst 5 |
| Global in-flight pair requests | 8 |
| Body size | 8 KiB |

Failed attempts cost the same as successful ones, with no escalating penalty. A
source that empties its bucket is delayed, not banned — there is no identity to
ban that costs a mesh peer anything to replace.

#### Port

`:4873` is a Myco constant, not negotiated: peers agree by running the same
version. That is fine pre-1.0, where a change here is a version bump rather than
a compatibility problem.

### Open questions

- **Peer-list poll wire format & endpoint.** Because all pairings are now mutual,
  the **transitive peer-list-poll authorization exists in v1** (any completed
  pairing authorizes the poll) — but the poll *mechanism itself* can still land
  later. Is the poll a dedicated Nostr event kind on the peer's relay, a
  Blossom-style listing, or a new FSP request? **TBD / open.**
- **Invite-pairing wire detail — the v1 mechanism.** The long random `pairSecret`
  in invite-pairing (§6.1) *is* the proof Alice paired with Ben: echoed back inside
  the Noise-encrypted channel, an unguessable single-use string a captured/relayed
  invite cannot reproduce. Invite-pairing is **the** v1 pairing path, so these are v1
  must-build, with detail still open: the token format and secret length, the
  on-device endpoint (a dedicated FSP port vs. a NIP-46-style channel on the embedded
  relay), and single-use / TTL / rate-limit enforcement. **TBD / open.**
- **Revocation / unpairing.** Removing a peer locally stops *us* polling them,
  but there is no negative announcement. Whether a peer should stop answering an
  old mutual pairing after the counterpart removed them is **TBD / open**.
- **Key backup / portability.** No `nsec` export in v1 (§2); migration story is
  **TBD / open**.
- **Multi-persona on one radio.** Whether the FIPS endpoint can host concurrent
  identities or must rebuild on persona switch (§3). **TBD / open.**
- **Memorable-name trust.** The memorable name is sender-chosen, non-unique text;
  the Library UI must never treat it as authority, should visually distinguish it
  from the npub, and should flag collisions (two peers who chose `green sammy`).
  Whether to derive the colour deterministically from the npub (so it's harder to
  spoof) is **TBD / open**.

## 7. Implemented in v0.0.3 — NFC tap-to-pair, single-use ledger, unpairing

How the app actually ships the §5–6 model, including a path the design above did
not anticipate (NFC) and where the wire detail landed.

**NFC tap-to-pair.** Alongside the QR path (§4), a device can present its invite
over NFC. While the user is on the Circle tab the app emulates a standard NDEF
Type-4 tag (Android host card emulation, AID `D2760000850101`) whose single URI
record is the same `myco://pair/<base64>` payload as the QR. The counterpart's OS
reads it through normal NDEF tag dispatch — no "reader mode" on either side — and
delivers the `myco://` link to the app via an intent filter, reaching the same
add-peer code path as a scan. Both phones present-and-poll at once, so a single
bump can pair symmetrically.

**Sharing an app over NFC, and the reader-mode exception.** The same emulation also
serves the app-share payload: the share sheet presents a `myco://share/<base64>`
URI (`{nsite, npub, name, secret}`), so a tap opens the shared app *and* pairs,
exactly like scanning its QR. This needed one carve-out from the "no reader mode"
rule above. The share and *Add an app* surfaces are modal bottom sheets, each shown
in its **own focused window**, where the OS's passive `NDEF_DISCOVERED` dispatch
(which reaches the Activity fine from the full-screen Circle tab) no longer arrives.
So while the *Add an app* sheet is open the app claims foreground NFC **reader
mode** and reads the tapped peer's tag itself. It is scoped strictly to that sheet
(the Circle bump path is unchanged and still uses passive dispatch), and it forwards
**only `myco://`-scheme URIs** to the same handler as a scan — an unrelated URL tag
held to the phone is read but ignored, never opened.

**Where the secret lives.** §6.1 framed the `pairSecret` as echoed back inside the
Noise-encrypted channel to `<npub_A>.fips`. The implementation keeps that property:
the scanner/tapper posts a signed pair **request** (kind 9101) to
`<npub_A>.fips:4873/pair` — already Noise-XK encrypted and authenticated to A —
carrying the secret. What differs from the doc is *who matches it*: A enforces
single-use locally, via a small persisted ledger of the secrets it has issued. Each
presented code mints a fresh secret; it is consumed on first accept and the
presented payload rotates, so a captured QR/tag can't pair twice.

**Auto-accept scope.** A request auto-accepts only while A is actively presenting
(on the Circle tab) and the secret matches a live issued one. A request that
arrives otherwise — A on another screen, or Myco launched by the tap — surfaces an
accept/ignore prompt instead, keeping the §6.1 human-in-the-loop confirmation.

**Unpairing (partially answers the open question above).** Forgetting a peer now
posts a signed **pair-remove** event (kind 9103) to their auth service; on receipt
they drop the sender from their Circle, so the two sides stay symmetric. Delivery
is retried on the same schedule as a request (about a minute), and a `403` from
the peer stops the loop rather than burning the whole window. A peer that stays
offline for the whole window keeps a stale entry until they forget us or we
re-pair. A durable (queue + ack) handshake is left open.

**Revocation reaches open connections.** Because admission to the content ports is
checked once, at the WebSocket upgrade, dropping a peer also **closes connections
they already hold** rather than only blocking the next one.

**NFC exposure.** While presenting, the emulated tag answers *any* NFC reader, not
just another Myco device, with `{npub, name, pairSecret}`. This is acceptable: the
npub is already public, the name is sender-chosen and low-sensitivity, and the
secret is single-use (a captured tag can't be replayed). It is deliberately limited
to the moments the user is on the Circle tab, not the whole time the app is open.
