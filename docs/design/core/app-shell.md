# The Android Shell & Launch Model

This document is the **Android shell and launch model** for Myco: how the
app presents itself on the device, how an nsite or napplet is launched and lives
as its own fullscreen "app", and why Myco imposes **no browser chrome** of its
own. For the vocabulary it builds on (nsite vs napplet, the three keys, `.fips`
vs `.localhost`, the Apps grid), read [concepts.md](./concepts.md) first;
for where the shell sits in the layer stack, see
[architecture.md](./architecture.md); for what the WebView actually loads, see
[nsite-layer.md](../nsite/nsite-layer.md); for the trust boundary around nsite content,
see [security.md](./security.md).

> Status: built. The one thing that changed from the design is the WebView
> host — `<host>.localhost`, not `<host>.nsite` (§7). "The Library" in the
> text is the **Apps** tab in the UI; the code still calls it the library.
> Napplets follow the same model with their own activity (§9).

## 1. Two kinds of surface: the manager and the apps

Myco has **two distinct UI surfaces**, and keeping them apart is the load-bearing
decision of this doc:

- **Myco the manager app** — its own home-screen icon, its own task. This is
  where you *manage* apps: add, remove, share, pin to the home screen, manage a
  napplet's permissions. Its UI is a bottom-nav shell: **Apps** (your installed
  nsites and napplets in one grid), **Circle** (pair by bump or QR, see
  [identity-pairing.md](./identity-pairing.md); your paired people; file
  sharing), **Discover** (apps your Circle holds — "around me"), **Settings**
  (radios, storage, identity, app reach), and a **Dev** tab.
- **Each nsite as its own fullscreen app** — launched *by* Myco but running in
  its **own task/instance**, filling the screen, with **no Myco UI around it at
  all**. To an Android user it looks and behaves like a separate app, not a tab
  inside Myco.

The manager is the home for "what do I have and how do I manage it"; the nsite is
the thing you actually use. You never browse an nsite *inside* the Myco manager —
opening one leaves the manager and starts the nsite as its own task.

---

## 2. The nsite as a separate fullscreen task

Each nsite launches as a fullscreen **`NsiteActivity`**: an Android `WebView`
filling the whole screen — **no toolbar, no URL bar, no Myco chrome**. It is its
own entry in Android Recents, switchable independently of the Myco manager.

The proposed mechanics:

- **`NsiteActivity`** is declared `android:documentLaunchMode="always"`, so each
  launch is a *distinct document* rather than reusing one activity instance.
- It is launched with **`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT`** and **without**
  `FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK`, with the intent **data URI keyed by the nsite host
  `<host>`** (§4) — so Android matches an existing task for that nsite and
  **re-surfaces it** instead of creating a duplicate.
- Each launch becomes its **own card in Android Recents**, showing the nsite's
  **title + favicon + colour** via
  [`ActivityManager.TaskDescription`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.TaskDescription),
  populated from the manifest (`["title", …]`, the `/favicon.ico` mapping).
- The activity loads exactly one URL: `http://<host>.localhost` (see §7). It never
  loads anything else; cross-device fetching is native code over `.fips`, which
  the WebView never sees.

So "open an nsite" = start **or re-surface** that nsite's `NsiteActivity` task. Two
*different* nsites open at once are two Recents cards; **opening the same nsite
again — from the Library, a home-screen shortcut, or a cross-nsite link —
re-surfaces the existing task** rather than spawning a second instance. There is
**one live instance per nsite**, keyed by `<host>`; this is achieved by omitting
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK` and keying the document by the `<host>` intent data.
(This resolves the earlier multiple-task open question.)

## 3. No Myco-imposed chrome

Myco adds **no** browser chrome to an nsite. There is no reload button, no back
bar, no "home" affordance painted over the page. Concretely:

- **Refresh, in-app navigation, and pull-to-refresh are the nsite developer's
  responsibility**, implemented *inside* the nsite (it is a normal web app; it
  can put its own nav, its own reload, its own pull-to-refresh in its HTML/JS).
  Myco does not supply them.
- **Android Back** walks the WebView history; when history is exhausted it
  **finishes the task** (the nsite closes, like any app).
- **Android Recents** is how you switch between running nsites and the Myco
  manager — it replaces the old in-shell "Library" button.

This is a deliberate inversion of the superseded model. Previously Myco wrapped
every site in a fixed bottom bar (Back · Reload · Library) and owned navigation;
now the platform (Back + Recents) owns task-level navigation and the **nsite
author owns everything inside the frame**. The shell's job shrinks to "launch the
right task and describe it to Recents."

> **Open question — which nsite am I in?** With no URL bar and no Myco chrome,
> the only on-screen signals of *which* nsite is running are the
> `TaskDescription` title/icon/colour in Recents and whatever the nsite itself
> renders. Both are **author-controlled**, so a hostile nsite can present a title
> and favicon impersonating another site. The shell has nowhere trusted to show
> the verified author npub once the activity is fullscreen. How to give the user
> a trustworthy "you are in site X, authored by npub1…" signal — without
> reintroducing chrome — is **TBD / open**. (This is the launch-model facet of
> the nsite-sandbox trust question in [security.md §5](./security.md).)

## 4. Intents and deep links are the glue

Launching is mediated entirely by intents, so the same mechanism serves the
Library, one nsite opening another, and a shared link:

- The scheme is **`myco://app/<host>`**, resolving to `NsiteActivity`, where
  `<host>` is the nsite's canonical single-token label — **`npub1…`** for a root
  site (kind 15128) or **`<pubkeyB36><dTag>`** for a named site (kind 35128),
  exactly as the nsite spec encodes it (base36 50-char pubkey directly followed by
  the 1–13-char `dTag`, no separator — the same single label used by
  `<host>.localhost`). One token, not an `npub/dTag` split.
- **Myco's Library** launches an nsite by firing this intent.
- **One nsite can open another** by the same intent (a link to
  `myco://app/<other-host>` starts — or re-surfaces (§2) — *that* nsite as its
  **own separate task**, never nested in the current WebView) — subject to the
  origin-isolation and capability constraints in [security.md](./security.md).
- **A shared link** (`myco://app/…` handed to you out of band) opens the site
  directly, the same way.

This `myco://app/…` launch scheme is distinct from `myco://pair/…` (QR pairing,
see [identity-pairing.md](./identity-pairing.md)) — same custom scheme, different
host. Both are deep-link intent filters Myco registers.

## 5. Home-screen icons: user-confirmed, best-effort presence

An nsite can be pinned to the device home screen so it launches like any installed
app, but Myco **cannot** silently place icons.

- Pinning uses
  [`ShortcutManager.requestPinShortcut()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ShortcutManager#requestPinShortcut(android.content.pm.ShortcutInfo,%20android.content.IntentSender)),
  which is **always user-confirmed** — Android shows a system dialog per pin.
  Myco can *offer* "Add to home screen" from the Library, but the user (and the
  launcher) get the final say.
- Myco also publishes **dynamic app-shortcuts** (long-press the Myco icon →
  recent/pinned nsites) for the sites you use most.

**Knowing whether an nsite is on the home screen is best-effort, not reliable.**

- [`getPinnedShortcuts()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ShortcutManager#getPinnedShortcuts())
  is the only signal, but **removal is under-reported** by non-stock launchers,
  there is **no removal callback**, and `LauncherApps` (which *could* enumerate
  pinned shortcuts) is **launcher-only** — a normal app cannot use it.
- Therefore **the Library is the source of truth for "installed."** Home-screen
  presence is a *soft hint* shown in the UI, never a fact the design relies on.
  Nothing must break if the hint is wrong (e.g. the user removed the icon and we
  never heard): the Library entry persists regardless, and re-pinning is always
  available.

## 6. Per-nsite origin isolation is automatic

Because each nsite is served under its own host (`<host>.localhost`, where `<host>`
is the author npub or `<pubkeyB36><dTag>` — see [concepts.md](./concepts.md) and
[nsite-layer.md §3.2](../nsite/nsite-layer.md)), each nsite is its **own web origin**.
The WebView therefore **partitions storage, cookies, and `localStorage` per
nsite automatically** — one nsite's data is isolated from another's by the
browser's same-origin policy, with no extra bookkeeping in the shell.

This reinforces the "separate app" framing at the data layer: an nsite in its own
task, in its own origin, with its own storage. It does **not** by itself solve the
cross-origin *capability* concerns (reaching `.fips`, exfiltration, sibling-site
tampering) — those remain the gateway/CSP responsibilities tracked in
[security.md §5](./security.md). Origin isolation is a necessary foundation, not
the whole sandbox.

---

## 7. How the shell relates to the gateway

The shell launches tasks; the **gateway** (see [nsite-layer.md](../nsite/nsite-layer.md))
makes them resolvable. The seam between them is one URL:

- `NsiteActivity` resolves its intent (`myco://app/<host>`) to a host
  label and loads **`http://<host>.localhost`** in its WebView — root site →
  `npub1…`, named site → `<pubkeyB36><dTag>`.
- Every request the WebView makes is answered by `shouldInterceptRequest`
  from the **in-process gateway** (`gatewayGet`): host → manifest → path →
  sha256 → bytes from the local relay and Blossom. No socket is bound and no
  DNS is consulted; the TUN is not involved. On a cache miss the gateway drives
  a sync over `.fips` (all native, invisible to the WebView).
- `.localhost`, not `.nsite`, because Chromium treats `*.localhost` as loopback
  and a secure context — which is what lets a page open `ws://localhost:4870`
  to the embedded relay without being blocked as a "public" page reaching a
  "local" network. The design originally locked `.nsite`; this is the reason
  it moved.
- The WebView **never** resolves `.fips` — the shell hands it only the
  `.localhost` URL.

So the division of labour is: **the shell decides *which* task to start and
describes it to Android; the gateway decides *what bytes* that task's one URL
serves.** Neither owns the other's concern.

---

## 8. Storage: clearing the cache vs. wiping everything

**Settings → Storage** shows local usage (against the ~2 GB cache target) and
offers two destructive actions, neither of which touches the device identity or
the Circle:

- **Delete cache** (`wipe_cache`) — reclaim space *without* breaking installed
  apps. It keeps every **pinned** Library entry working offline by computing a
  keep-set from the pinned sites — each one's *served* manifest event plus the
  blob hashes that manifest references — and retaining only those, then dropping
  everything else: unpinned opened sites, discovered listings, and staged
  updates. A pinned site whose manifest isn't local stays pinned and simply
  re-downloads on next open.
- **Delete all data, including apps** (`wipe_stores`) — clear the local relay +
  Blossom + Library + status wholesale, pinned apps included.

The keep-set is derived through the same **active-manifest** pointer the gateway
serves from (see [nsite-updates.md §1](../nsite/nsite-updates.md)), so a cache wipe
preserves exactly the version currently served, not whatever newest manifest the
relay happens to hold. A general size-based eviction pass (P5) is still open;
until then these two explicit actions are the only reclamation path.

## 9. Open questions

- **Impersonation without chrome (§3).** No trusted, always-visible signal of
  which verified author npub a fullscreen nsite belongs to; `TaskDescription`
  and in-page content are author-controlled. **TBD / open.**
- **Home-screen presence accuracy (§5).** `getPinnedShortcuts()` is unreliable
  for removal on non-stock launchers; we treat the Library as truth, but the
  exact UX for a stale "on home screen" hint is **TBD / open.**
- **Cross-nsite launch policy (§4).** When one nsite opens another via
  `myco://app/…`, what (if any) confirmation or origin check the shell interposes
  is **TBD / open** (ties into [security.md §5](./security.md)).
- **Cold-start latency.** Launching a fresh `NsiteActivity` task that immediately
  needs a sync (uncached site) versus showing the gateway loading page inside the
  new task — the perceived-launch experience is **TBD / open.**

---

## 9. Napplets: the same model, one more wall

A napplet launches exactly like an nsite — its own task, its own Recents card,
no chrome, `myco://napplet/<naddr>` as the intent — but in `NappletActivity`,
not `NsiteActivity`, because the content is a program. The WebView loads a
trusted **shell page** from the APK at `<label>.napplet.localhost`; the shell
mounts the verified napplet in a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` `srcdoc` iframe,
whose origin is opaque. The napplet reaches nothing but the shell, by
`postMessage`; the shell reaches Rust over an origin-scoped
`addWebMessageListener` channel; Rust does what the napplet's grants allow.
Frames from Rust (subscription events, "relaunch") are drained by a long poll
off the main thread. Closing the window closes the session. Design:
[../napplet/napplet-runtime.md](../napplet/napplet-runtime.md) §5.
