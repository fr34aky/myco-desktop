# Security & Trust Model

This document describes Myco's security posture: what is authenticated, what
is authorized, who is trusted, and what is explicitly out of scope. Where a
section describes something not yet built it says so; everything else describes
the app as it stands.

The short version: **Myco trusts data, not peers — and trusts people, not
radios.** Every artifact it exchanges — Nostr events and Blossom blobs — is
self-authenticating, so any relay or peer is safe to use as a *source* of that
data. A source can withhold or lie about *availability*, but it cannot forge
content. There is no network-membership question: FIPS links to whoever is in
range, and that says nothing. The questions that matter are "is this packet
from who it claims" (yes, by FIPS transport crypto), "is this content what it
claims" (yes, by signature/hash), and "is this person in my Circle" (yes or no,
by a pairing two people made) — which is what admits a peer to the content
ports. A fourth question arrived with napplets: "may this *program* do that"
(yes or no, by a grant the user made; §5).

> **Note on the name "FIPS".** Throughout Myco, *FIPS* is the **Free
> Internet Protocol Suite** (the mesh project this app is built on), **not**
> the U.S. NIST Federal Information Processing Standards. Nothing here is a
> claim of FIPS-140 validated cryptography. The primitives below (secp256k1,

## 1. Self-authenticating data: trust the artifact, not the channel

Myco moves two kinds of artifact, and both are verifiable independently of
who handed them to you:

- **Nostr events** (the relay layer). nsite manifests are signed Nostr events:
  kind `15128` (root site) and `35128` (named site), whose tags map paths to
  blob hashes, e.g. `["path","/index.html","<sha256>"]`
  (`../../reference/site-deck/docs/nsite-protocol.md` (nsite-deck reference)).
  Every event carries a secp256k1 Schnorr signature over its content and an
  author pubkey. The receiver verifies the signature before trusting the event.
  A forged or tampered manifest fails verification and is discarded.
- **Blossom blobs** (the content layer). Blobs are content-addressed by
  SHA-256 (Blossom BUD-01;
  the nsite-deck reference). The manifest names a
  blob by its hash; the receiver hashes the bytes it got and checks them against
  that name. A substituted or corrupted blob has a different hash and is
  rejected.

The consequence is the central security property of the whole propagation
model:

> **Any relay or peer is trustworthy as a *source*.** It can refuse to serve
> you, serve you stale data, or claim a site exists that does not — a
> *withholding* / *availability* attack — but it **cannot forge** content
> attributed to an author it does not control. Signatures and hashes make
> origin and integrity independent of the transport.

This is what makes the offline-propagation design safe. When your local relay +
Blossom server caches Alice's signed events and content-addressed blobs and
later re-serves them to Carl while Alice is unreachable
([diagrams/03-offline-propagation.svg](../diagrams/03-offline-propagation.svg)),
Carl is not trusting *you* — he is verifying Alice's signature and the blob
hashes himself. A new source is as good as the original source. This is the
property that lets relays and blobs hop across "crappy links in all directions"
without a trusted intermediary.

### 1.1 Where signatures are checked

Transport authenticity and event authorship are different claims, and
store-and-forward pulls them apart. FIPS Noise IK plus the identity-derived
`fd00::` address proves **who sent the frame**. It says nothing about **who
signed the event**, because peers routinely hand us events authored by third
parties they have never met.

Manifests are the sharp case. An nsite manifest is authored by its publisher and
the peer relaying it is only a courier, so without verification any paired peer
could hand us a forged manifest for anyone's nsite and we would stage and
activate it as that publisher's site. Content-addressing does not save us: blob
hashes are checked against the manifest, and the manifest is the forged part.

So verification happens **once, at ingress** — the points where a remote event
enters the process. It used to be a habit repeated at nine scattered call sites,
which is a pattern where a single missed one is a silent forgery hole.

Events read back **out** of our own store are not re-verified. NIP-01 already
makes signature checking mandatory for a relay accepting an `EVENT`, so paying
Schnorr again per event on a phone buys nothing. That trade is worth restating if
Myco is ever pointed at a relay it does not own — see
[nsite-layer.md §2.1](../nsite/nsite-layer.md), where that is a planned setting with a
warning attached.

What self-authentication does **not** give you:

- **Freshness / non-equivocation.** A replaceable event (`35128`) can be
  withheld so you keep an older signed version; the signature is still valid,
  so you cannot tell you are behind. There is no global ordering. Mitigation is
  pull-from-many: query every reachable relay and keep the newest valid
  `created_at` (see the "nsites around me" search default). This is best-effort,
  not a guarantee.
- **Author intent / key compromise.** A valid signature proves the key signed
  it, not that the human meant to. A stolen **external author** key (the keys
  that author nsites elsewhere — never a Myco device key) can sign valid
  malicious updates that then propagate. A device that caches and re-serves such
  content is still only a *source*, not the author — signatures attribute it to
  the compromised author key, not to the re-serving device. Myco has no
  revocation mechanism for author keys in v1 (TBD / open — Nostr has no native
  key revocation).

## 2. Transport crypto inherited from FIPS

Myco does not invent transport security; it inherits the FIPS two-layer
crypto wholesale by embedding the upstream `fips` crate in-process.

- **End-to-end (session layer, FSP): Noise XK.**
  `Noise_XK_secp256k1_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`. The two session endpoints (the two
  npubs actually talking) authenticate each other and encrypt the payload
  end-to-end. Intermediate mesh nodes route on the destination `node_addr` but
  **cannot read the payload**
  ([../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-session-layer.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-session-layer.md)).
- **Per-hop (link layer, FMP): Noise IK.**
  `Noise_IK_secp256k1_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`. Each direct link between adjacent
  nodes is independently authenticated and encrypted. A peer you forward
  through sees ciphertext and routing headers, not content
  ([../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-mesh-layer.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-mesh-layer.md)).
- **Both layers** use ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD, SHA-256 transcript hashing,
  HKDF-SHA256 key schedule, counter-based nonces with a 2048-entry sliding
  replay window, and periodic rekey
  ([../../reference/fips/docs/reference/security.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/reference/security.md)).

**BLE links are pubkey-authenticated.** On the offline BLE path
([diagrams/01-system-layering.svg](../diagrams/01-system-layering.svg)), after the
L2CAP CoC connect, the peers exchange a pre-handshake pubkey frame
(`[0x00][pubkey:32]` = 33 bytes) and then run Noise IK to authenticate the link
([../../reference/fips/src/transport/ble/io.rs](../../../reference/fips/src/transport/ble/io.rs),
[../../reference/fips/src/transport/ble/mod.rs](../../../reference/fips/src/transport/ble/mod.rs)).
Identity is the **pubkey**, never the MAC address — so Android MAC
randomization is harmless, and a spoofed MAC gains nothing because it cannot
complete the Noise handshake. BLE adverts are UUID-only and carry no identity
material, so passive scanners learn only that a FIPS device is nearby, not who.

The crucial inherited principle, carried over verbatim from FIPS:

> **Identity is authenticated; identity is *not* authorization.** Knowing
> cryptographically who sent a packet does not by itself decide whether you
> should act on it
> ([../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-security.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-security.md)).

## 3. No membership gate on the mesh — a Circle gate on the content

The mesh is not private. Any FIPS node in range gets a Noise-authenticated
link and may route your encrypted datagrams; there is no roster, no admin, no
join event, and nothing to gate. What *is* gated is the content: the relay and
Blossom servers check every mesh connection against the **Circle** — the list
of people this phone has paired with — and refuse everyone else before the
WebSocket upgrade or the first byte of a blob. That check is not a roster: it
is a purely local list, symmetric, with no signer and no authority beyond this
device. See [../circle/circle.md](../circle/circle.md) for what the Circle is
and is not.

What this means:

- **Being a peer confers nothing.** A phone can hold a link to yours for an
  hour and never read a byte of content. It reaches exactly one service: the
  auth port, to ask to pair (§3.2).
- **Being paired confers the data relationship.** A Circle member may read your
  relay and store, receive your gossip, offer you apps, send you files. All of
  it is self-authenticating (§1), so what a member is "authorized" to do is
  narrow: exchange verifiable artifacts, and be believed about *having* them.
- **Not conferred by pairing:** reading your end-to-end payloads to others,
  forging or altering content, learning your identity from a passive BLE scan,
  reaching arbitrary localhost services on your phone (§3.1).

**The FIPS optional peer ACL still exists upstream** (`peers.allow` /
`peers.deny`, evaluated at the Noise IK handshake;
[../../reference/fips/docs/reference/security.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/reference/security.md)).
Myco does not use it: pairing is the gesture. A "block this peer" control that
re-exposes it is a later item.

### 3.1 Inbound surface on the mesh

FIPS FSP port-multiplexing delivers mesh datagrams to localhost ports, so a peer
can reach your services over `.fips`
([../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-session-layer.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-session-layer.md)).
On Linux, FIPS recommends a default-deny nftables baseline to bound this surface;
**on Android there is no nftables equivalent the app controls.** The app's
mitigation is to expose *only* its own ports over the mesh — the VpnService/TUN
routes only `fd00::/8` and answers `*.fips` DNS; it does **not**
capture `0.0.0.0/0`, and the WebView never resolves `.fips`.

Three ports are exposed, and only one of them answers a stranger.

| Port | Service | Who may reach it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `4870` | Relay (the mesh proxy's NIP-01 socket) | Circle members only |
| `24243` | Blossom blob store | Circle members only |
| `4873` | Auth service — `POST /pair`, nothing else | **Anyone** |

**Open question:** confirm that no other localhost service on the phone is
inadvertently reachable via FSP port-multiplexing on a paired path, and whether
the app should enforce an explicit port allowlist on the inbound mesh side.

### 3.2 One open port, one membership predicate

The content ports have **no exceptions**. Pairing used to need one — an unpaired
peer had to be able to publish the three handshake kinds so pairing could
bootstrap — which meant a kind whitelist inside the relay's frame handling.
Pairing now terminates at its own service ([identity-pairing.md
§6.2](./identity-pairing.md)), so:

- **Admission is one predicate:** is this mesh address in my circle? The same
  question answers for relay and Blossom alike.
- **It is checked at accept, not per frame.** An unpaired peer is refused
  **before** the WebSocket upgrade, with a plain `403`. A stranger costs a TCP
  accept and one small response rather than an upgrade and a round of frames,
  which matters on a BLE link.
- **The relay refuses the pairing kinds from every source**, paired or not.
  Nothing writes control traffic into the event store.
- **`:4873` is the only unauthenticated surface in the app**, so hardening and
  rate limiting have a single address instead of emerging from a whitelist.

**Revocation closes live connections.** Because admission is checked once, at the
upgrade, removing a peer also drops the connections it already holds rather than
only blocking the next request. Membership is consulted live, so the change takes
effect immediately.

### 3.3 Per-peer permissions

Paired is no longer all-or-nothing. Each circle contact carries six flags —
relay read, relay read-multihop, relay write, relay write-multihop, Blossom read,
Blossom write — all on by default **except Blossom write**, which is off. Full
table and rationale: [nsite-permissions.md §2](../nsite/nsite-permissions.md).

Two consequences worth stating here:

- **Uploads are not granted by default.** Nothing in normal operation pushes
  blobs to a peer (propagation is pull-based), so accepting bytes onto our disk
  is opt-in. A missing field in an older `circle.json` cannot silently grant it.
- **Relaying for a peer is a separate grant from talking to it.** The two
  multihop flags are per-peer clamps on the hop budgets, so "I will hold your
  data but not carry it further" is expressible.

The flags are stored per peer today but **not exposed in the UI**; every peer gets
the defaults.

### 3.4 What a circle member can still learn

Read access is deliberately broad for members, because a peer *must* be able to
read your relay/Blossom to become a new source, and the data is public-by-design
(author-signed manifests, content-addressed blobs) — so it leaks no secret.

The honest exposure is **metadata, not confidentiality**: a member can issue a
broad `REQ` and **enumerate your whole manifest set**, learning *which sites you
hold, installed, or cached for others*. That is the same privacy signal as *which
manifests you choose to replicate* (see [propagation.md](../nsite/propagation.md)), not a
content leak. Narrower read scoping — unlisted/private nsites, selective
replication, filtering by kind per peer — remains **additive and deferred**. The
coarse knobs today are unpairing, the per-peer read flag, and the FIPS peer ACL
("block this peer", above).

## 4. Pairing trust: scan-and-confirm, mutual by default

Pairing is the one moment a human asserts "this is who I think it is."

- The QR payload is `myco://pair/<base64>` carrying JSON
  **`{ npub, name, pairSecret }`** — the inviter's npub, an optional memorable
  name, and a **`pairSecret`**: a long, high-entropy random string (≈256 bits),
  single-use, that the scanning peer echoes back to complete the handshake. There
  is still no MAC and no PSM in the payload (those are
  learned later over BLE adverts; see
  [diagrams/02-pairing-transitive-discovery.svg](../diagrams/02-pairing-transitive-discovery.svg)).
  The same payload is presented as an NFC tag, so a bump is a scan
  ([identity-pairing.md §7](./identity-pairing.md)).
- **The trust model is scan-and-confirm over an already-encrypted channel, not
  bare TOFU.** Scanning the QR does not merely bind an npub on faith — it initiates
  the mandatory **invite-pairing handshake** against the inviter's on-device auth
  service at `<npub>.fips:4873`. That channel is already **Noise-XK authenticated and
  encrypted** to the inviter's device key, so the scanner just **echoes the
  `pairSecret` back** inside it; the inviter matches the (single-use) secret and the
  human taps **OK** to confirm the memorable name
  ([identity-pairing.md § 6.1](./identity-pairing.md)). No password-authenticated
  key exchange is needed — FIPS already supplies the authenticated, confidential
  channel, and the long random secret is simply an unguessable proof-of-scan.
  Completing the handshake makes the two devices **mutual sources** of each other.
  This is the only pairing path; pairing is **always mutual** and **always
  handshake-gated**. The cryptographic guarantee afterward is strong: every later
  BLE/mesh contact is Noise-authenticated against that exact pubkey, so a
  man-in-the-middle without the private key cannot impersonate the paired peer on
  subsequent connections.
- **The handshake closes the relay-MITM / malicious-QR gap by default.** Three
  things stack up: the channel to `<npub>.fips:4873` is Noise-authenticated to the
  inviter's key (a passive relay between the two devices learns nothing and cannot
  impersonate either end), the `pairSecret` is a single-use, unguessable random
  string echoed *inside* that encrypted channel (a captured or relayed invite cannot
  reproduce or replay it), and the inviter's **OK prompt** shows the scanner's npub +
  memorable name so the human rejects a wrong or racing peer. This is a meaningful
  improvement over the old bare-TOFU posture, where scanning an attacker's npub
  silently authenticated every later session *to the attacker*. Pairing still rests
  on the human scanning the intended invite. **Open:** whether to add an
  *additional* out-of-band step (e.g. comparing a short authentication string) for
  higher-assurance pairing on top of the OK confirmation.
- **Both devices must be reachable at pairing time.** The handshake is a live
  round-trip, so inviter and scanner must both be online to each other when the
  QR is scanned. In practice they are physically together, so the BLE link is up
  — the handshake runs over BLE (or IP). There is no deferred / offline pairing:
  if the inviter's auth service is not reachable, pairing does not complete. It
  does, however, survive a broken content plane: a taken relay port or a
  misconfigured store does not stop two phones pairing, which is the one
  operation that could repair the situation.
- **`pairSecret` authenticates, it does not authorize.** Holding the secret lets
  a peer complete the handshake; it confers **no membership and no admin
  authority** (there is no roster or admin to join — §3). After pairing, the
  relationship is exactly "mutual data source," nothing more.
- **Transitive discovery.** Once paired, peers may learn of *further* peers
  through the mesh. Discovery is not the same as pairing: a transitively
  discovered npub is still just a data source whose every artifact you verify,
  and it has **not** completed the mutual handshake with you. No transitively
  discovered peer gains any authority a directly paired one lacks, because
  pairing confers no authority beyond "exchange verifiable data."

## 5. Two sandboxes: the nsite's and the napplet's

### 5.1 The nsite sandbox — pure static, no capabilities

An nsite is served to the in-app WebView at `http://<host>.localhost/` by the
in-process gateway, after manifest and hash verification
([diagrams/04-nsite-browse-flow.svg](../diagrams/04-nsite-browse-flow.svg)).
It is *just signed static files* — HTML, CSS, JS, images — authored elsewhere by
an external author. There is **no capability API**: nsite JavaScript cannot
query peers, reach the store's control surface, or sign anything. The threat
surface is the ordinary web-content surface, scoped down:

- nsite JS runs in the WebView's normal sandbox as untrusted third-party code.
- **Per-nsite origin isolation is automatic.** Each nsite is its own origin —
  `<host>.localhost` — so storage, cookies and scripting are partitioned per
  site; each launches as its own `NsiteActivity` and WebView.
- The WebView never resolves `.fips`, which keeps nsite JS off the sync
  transport. What it *can* reach is `ws://localhost:4870` — the embedded relay,
  as any local web page could. Today an event published there is gossiped to
  the Circle at the default hop budget; that is being removed (roadmap N2), so
  that reaching the room is a *granted* capability (below) rather than a side
  effect of a loopback socket.
- No `file://`, no Myco chrome to redirect, no shared navigation surface.

### 5.2 The napplet sandbox — a program behind a permission model

A napplet is a program, and it gets exactly what the user granted. The design
is in [../napplet/napplet-runtime.md](../napplet/napplet-runtime.md); the
security shape is:

- **Two walls.** The napplet runs in a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` `srcdoc`
  iframe with an **opaque origin**: no storage, no network, no same-origin
  access to anything. Around it is a trusted shell page from the APK, and around
  that the WebView's channel to Rust, scoped to the shell's origin. The napplet
  can only `postMessage` to the shell; a nested frame, a popup, or a message
  from any other source is dropped by a `MessageEvent.source` check.
- **Every capability is mediated.** The napplet describes what it wants
  (`relay.publish {event}`, `mesh.subscribe {filters, ttl}`,
  `resource.bytes {url}`); Rust decides, does it, and returns the result. No
  key material, no socket, no file handle ever crosses into the iframe. The
  user key signs on the napplet's behalf; the napplet never sees it (§7.1 of
  the runtime design).
- **Grants are the user's, per call.** What a napplet may do is decided at
  install review — in words, on a screen the fetch cannot skip — and can be
  changed per capability on its sheet. The check is made on **every call**
  and every delivery, so revoking a grant stops the next call, not the next
  launch. Nothing an inbound intent carries can widen a grant: grants are read
  from the library, never passed at open.
- **A napplet's identity is its bytes.** The aggregate hash over the manifest
  is the session identity; a different build is a different napplet, and a
  manifest whose files do not hash to it never gets a session.
- **What a grant lets a napplet do to you** is said plainly on the review
  screen because it is real: `relay` and `mesh` let it publish *as you*, to
  your relays or to everyone in your Circle, with no per-event prompt.
  `resource` lets it fetch content by hash — and, because fetched blobs are
  kept and served, makes you a holder of what it looked at (the open privacy
  question in the runtime design, §7.11).
- **Napplet-supplied addresses are validated.** A relay URL a napplet names
  must be `ws`/`wss` and may not point at loopback or a private network; a
  `.fips` URL is honoured only for a Circle member. Blob fetches are content
  addressed, so there is no address to abuse.

## 6. Threats and mitigations

| Threat | What an attacker gains | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| **Malicious / forging relay or peer** | Tries to serve forged content | **Cannot forge.** Signatures + SHA-256 verified locally (§1); bad artifacts are rejected. |
| **Withholding / availability attack** | Refuses to serve, serves stale, hides a newer event | Pull-from-many: query all reachable relays, keep newest valid event; manifests flood widely (announce-wide) while large blobs are pulled on demand. Best-effort, no freshness guarantee (§1). |
| **Storage-exhaustion DoS** | Floods your cache with junk blobs/events to evict your data or fill the disk | Only Circle members reach the content ports at all, and **blob upload is off by default per peer** (§3.3), so a peer cannot push bytes onto your disk unless you grant it. Junk that fails verification is never stored (§1). **Not built:** an LRU cap (roadmap); today the store grows until the user deletes the cache. |
| **Identity / link spoofing** | Pretends to be a paired peer | Noise IK/XK over secp256k1; identity is pubkey not MAC; spoof cannot complete handshake (§2). |
| **Replay** | Re-injects captured datagrams | 2048-entry sliding replay window at both FMP and FSP layers (§2). |
| **Malicious / relayed QR at pairing** | Tries to bind the attacker's npub as your paired peer | Scan-and-confirm over Noise: the single-use, unguessable `pairSecret` is echoed back inside the Noise-authenticated channel to the inviter's `<npub>.fips:4873` and confirmed by the inviter's OK prompt, so a captured/relayed invite cannot bind (§4). Optional out-of-band safety-string check on top is an open proposal (§4). |
| **DoS on the auth port** | Floods `:4873`, the one port open to strangers, to burn a BLE radio | Per-source token bucket (1/s, burst 5), a global in-flight ceiling of 8, and an 8 KiB body cap. Over-limit is a delay, not a ban — there is no identity to ban that costs a mesh peer anything to replace (§3.2, [identity-pairing.md §6.2](./identity-pairing.md)). |
| **Stranger writing to your event store** | Gets data into a store you may not own | Pairing kinds are refused on the relay from every source; the handshake never touches the store. Unpaired peers are refused before the WebSocket upgrade (§3.2). |
| **Revoked peer keeps reading** | An unpaired peer's open subscription keeps streaming | Membership is re-checked on delivery and the connection is dropped, so revocation reaches connections that already exist (§3.2). |
| **Malicious nsite content** | Untrusted JS in the WebView | Pure-static, no capability API; per-nsite origin isolation; WebView never resolves `.fips` (§5.1). |
| **Malicious napplet** | Untrusted program asks for more than it should, or tries to go around the seam | Opaque-origin iframe; every capability mediated and checked per call against the user's grants; no key material in the iframe; refused calls are logged (§5.2). |
| **A napplet publishing as you** | A granted `relay`/`mesh` napplet posts without asking | By design and said in words at install; revocable per capability, effective on the next call; the hop budget is capped by the user (NAP-MESH). |
| **Napplet-named relay as SSRF** | A napplet points the shell at a private host | Relay URLs validated: `ws`/`wss` only, no loopback or private ranges; `.fips` only for Circle members (§5.2). |
| **Propagation-privacy leak** | Observers learn what you host / re-serve | See below — partial mitigation only (open). |
| **Metadata / traffic analysis** | A forwarding peer sees who-talks-to-whom | FIPS routes on `node_addr`, payload is end-to-end encrypted; FIPS rejects onion routing, so traffic-graph metadata is visible to forwarders by design ([../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-mesh-operation.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-mesh-operation.md)). |

### Propagation privacy — "what am I hosting / re-serving?"

The offline-propagation design makes your device a **source** for sites it has
cached, including sites you merely browsed and then re-serve to others. That is
the point of the mesh, but it has a privacy cost:

- A peer that queries your relay/Blossom can learn **which sites you hold** —
  i.e. infer what you have browsed or chosen to cache. Hosting a site is
  observable.
- Re-serving signed content does not implicate you as its author (signatures
  attribute it to the original author, not the re-server), but *possession* is
  still a signal.

This is an open area. Candidate directions (all TBD / open): a distinction
between *pinned/propagated* sites (Library sites whose manifests you intend to flood
onward) and *transient cache* whose manifests you do not re-emit to peers; a
setting to disable re-serving entirely; not re-flooding manifests for content you
only transiently fetched. v1 should at minimum make "which manifests you are
replicating as a source" visible and controllable in the UI rather than implicit.
**Open question:** default propagation posture — replicate manifests for
everything cached, or only Library-pinned sites?

## 7. Explicit non-goals and open questions

- **Not FIPS-140.** Restated: Myco makes **no** US-NIST FIPS-140 validated
  cryptography claim. "FIPS" = Free Internet Protocol Suite (§ note at top).
- **No anonymity / onion routing.** Inherited from FIPS, which deliberately
  rejects onion routing; forwarders see the traffic graph. Myco does not add
  an anonymity layer.
- **No author-key revocation** in v1 (no native Nostr mechanism). A compromised
  **external** author key (never a Myco device key) can sign valid malicious
  updates that propagate until users stop following it; a device re-serving them
  is a source, not the author.
- **No freshness guarantee.** Self-authentication proves origin/integrity, not
  recency; withholding a newer replaceable event is undetectable in general.
- **Per-nsite origin isolation** is automatic: each nsite is its own origin
  (`<host>.localhost`), so WebView storage/cookies/scripting partition per nsite and
  one nsite cannot read another's data (§5). **Open:** CSP enforcement on top to
  bound off-origin exfiltration.
- **Open / TBD — which nsite am I in?** With each nsite launching fullscreen and
  **no URL bar or Myco chrome**, a user has no app-supplied indicator of which
  nsite they are currently in. The Recents card title/icon come from the nsite's
  own `ActivityManager.TaskDescription`, which is **author-controlled** — so a
  malicious nsite can present another nsite's title/favicon/colour, an
  impersonation/spoofing risk. How (or whether) Myco surfaces a trustworthy
  "you are in `<host>`" signal without re-imposing chrome is unresolved.
- **Open:** explicit inbound port allowlist on the FSP-multiplexed mesh surface
  on Android (§3).
- **Open:** optional out-of-band pairing verification (§4).
- **Open:** propagation-privacy controls and default manifest-replication posture (§6).
- **Open:** whether to re-surface the FIPS peer ACL as a "block peer" control
  (§3).
