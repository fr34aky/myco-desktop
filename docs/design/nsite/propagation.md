The vision is nak's "Pillars of Propagation": small relays and Blossom blobs
hopping over crappy links in all directions, surviving outages via local
propagation. The headline scenario: an nsite authored by Alice (with external
nsite tooling, off-device) enters the mesh; the device holding it goes offline;
Carl — who has never met that holder — still gets a verified copy of Alice's
site, because Ben carried it across in between. The app never authors, signs, or
publishes nsites; it only **stores, serves, and replicates** other people's
already-signed events and content-addressed blobs. See
[diagrams/03-offline-propagation.svg](../diagrams/03-offline-propagation.svg).

This document specifies how that works. The single most important boundary it
draws: **FIPS transport does not do this.** Offline propagation is net-new and
lives at the relay/nsite layer.

## 1. The two-layer model

Propagation is split across two layers that must not be conflated.

### Layer A — FIPS transport: live-path routing only

`fips-core` gives multi-hop, end-to-end-encrypted delivery across the mesh
spanning tree, but only between nodes that have a *live* path at the moment of
sending. Intermediate nodes route on the destination `node_addr` and cannot read
the payload (Noise XK end-to-end over FSP, Noise IK hop-by-hop over FMP).
Crucially, routing is **live-path only — there is no store-and-forward in the
transport** ([../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-session-layer.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-session-layer.md),
[fips-mesh-layer.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-mesh-layer.md),
[fips-spanning-tree.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-spanning-tree.md)).

If Alice is offline or out of range, FIPS cannot reach her, full stop. It will
not queue your request and deliver it when she reappears. By itself, Layer A
does not let data survive a partition.

### Layer B — nsite store-and-forward: net-new, survives partition

The behaviour "cache Alice's site and re-serve it to Carl later, offline" is
**net-new** and is implemented at the nsite/relay layer. The embedded relay
(`myco-relay`, a plain NIP-01 store + socket) and Blossom server
(the nsite-deck reference) retain peers' signed
events and content-addressed blobs and thereby **become a new source**. When
Ben's device caches Alice's site, Ben can serve it to Carl over a fresh BLE hop
even though Alice's original holder is nowhere in sight. The re-emission of
Alice's already-signed manifest relay-to-relay is done by the **nsite-deck
propagator** (not by the relay itself; see §2) — Ben is a *holder*, not the
author; his device never signs anything on Alice's behalf.

This is the layer that survives offline / partition. It is patterned on
bitchat's offline mesh primitives (used as a *pattern reference only* — its
GATT transport and crypto are not used; see §5), applied to Nostr events and
Blossom blobs instead of bitchat packets.

| | Layer A — FIPS transport | Layer B — nsite store-and-forward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provenance | reused from `fips-core` | net-new in Myco |
| Unit | opaque encrypted datagrams | signed Nostr events + sha256 blobs |
| Reach | live end-to-end path only | any node that ever cached the content |
| Survives partition? | no | **yes** |
| Trust model | hop crypto (can't read payload) | self-authenticating data (§4) |

The boundary is load-bearing: every time this doc says "propagate", "announce",
or "pull", it means Layer B riding *on top of* whatever live links Layer A
happens to provide right now. The two BLE hops in
[diagrams/03-offline-propagation.svg](../diagrams/03-offline-propagation.svg) (Alice→Ben
at t1, Ben→Carl at t2) need never overlap in time. The two layers are drawn
side by side in [diagrams/08-two-layer-propagation.svg](../diagrams/08-two-layer-propagation.svg).

## 2. Hybrid announce / pull design

The proposed default (a [LOCKED DECISION], vetoable in its parameters) is
**HYBRID: announce widely, pull full content on demand.** This keeps the chatty,
fan-out part of propagation small (the author-signed manifest event) and the
heavy part (the referenced blobs) lazy and demand-driven.

### Announce (flood the author-signed manifest, 3 hops)

The unit that propagates is the **author-signed nsite manifest event itself**
(nsite kinds `15128` root / `35128` named;
the nsite-deck reference) —
small, self-authenticating, and keyed by the *author's* pubkey plus, for named
sites, the `d` tag. There is **no separate availability-announcement event and no
new event kind**: a holder that wants to "announce" a site simply re-emits the
author's manifest unchanged. Re-emitting an already-signed event relay-to-relay
is normal relay behaviour, not authoring, and requires no holder signature.

- Manifests flood outward with a hop budget: **3 hops** (`EVENT_TTL`), the
  same budget as any gossiped event. Each forwarder decrements, and a spent
  budget is stored but not forwarded; the seen-set, not the budget, is what
  guarantees termination ([event-gossip.md §3](../core/event-gossip.md)).
- **Only manifests propagate multi-hop. Blobs stay pull-only** — there is no
  TTL-flood of blobs.

#### Mechanism: the nsite-deck propagator

The flood is not a bespoke protocol, and it is **not relay behaviour** — the
embedded `myco-relay` is a plain NIP-01 store + socket that never fans anything
out on its own. The fanout is the job of a separate **propagator** process
inside `nsite-deck`. The propagator holds an internal **subscription** to the
relevant relays (the local `myco-relay` plus the relays of connected peers) and,
when it sees a manifest, **publishes** it — an `["EVENT", …]` to each
`<peer>.fips:4870` relay, source excluded — so a manifest ripples outward one
relay-hop at a time. "Connected peers" are your live FIPS links (directly paired
peers and, transitively, their peers — §3). This is push-based: a node need not
ask for a site to learn it exists; the propagator at a connected neighbour
volunteers the manifest. The relay store, the sync engine, and the propagator
share one event intake, so an event learned by any path is both stored locally
and re-published once. Loop/duplicate suppression is in §5; the propagator-side
behaviour is specified in [./nsite-layer.md §2.1](./nsite-layer.md). It is wanted
**early** (roadmap P2), with transitive discovery and scale-dedup layered on at
P4.

**This is Plumtree.** The fanout is the **eager-push** half of a Plumtree-style
epidemic broadcast; negentropy reconciliation (§5) is the **lazy-pull** half that
repairs gaps. This mirrors how bitchat propagates messages offline (eager gossip +
periodic reconciliation — we mirror the *cadence*, not bitchat's GCS wire; ours is
negentropy). Two bitchat patterns keep convergence prompt without
constant chatter, both **strictly neighbour-local (never relayed)**: (1) **eager
reconcile on a new link** — fire a one-shot reconcile the moment a peer connects
(bitchat sends a unicast sync ~5 s after a new neighbour appears); and (2) a slow
**periodic neighbour reconcile** (bitchat ~30 s, bounded to ~100 recent items). See
§5 for the negentropy mechanics. What shipped instead of both is simpler: the
relay pool keeps one connection per Circle member and, on every (re)connect,
replays each open local subscription against them (`resync_from_peer`).

### Pull (fetch content on demand)

When a user opens a site — or when the **propagator eagerly pre-fetches a pinned
one** — the app *pulls* the actual content from a holder whose manifest it has:
it already has (or queries for) the manifest event, then fetches each referenced
blob by sha256 from that holder's Blossom server (`<npub_holder>.fips:24243`),
verifies, and caches. The pre-fetch is owned by the propagator's **pinned-site
subscription** (an internal subscription for kinds `15128`/`35128`): when a
*newer* manifest arrives for a Library-pinned `(author, dTag)`, the propagator
auto-runs this blob pull in the background so pinned apps stay current and
offline-ready before the user next opens them (see
[./nsite-layer.md §5.4](./nsite-layer.md)). The manifest identifies the site by the **author** pubkey; the holder it
is pulled from is a *different* key, reached at `<npub_holder>.fips`. A holder's
relay is queried with `{kinds:[15128 or 35128], authors:[<author_pubkey>]}`. The
browse lifecycle is detailed in
[diagrams/04-nsite-browse-flow.svg](../diagrams/04-nsite-browse-flow.svg); from
propagation's point of view the key facts are: pulls are point-to-point Layer-A
fetches against a holder, and every pulled object is verified before it is cached
(§4) — so the pull source need not be the original author or its first holder.

This split means a site can be *known to be available* across many hops cheaply
(the manifest has flooded), while the bytes only ever traverse the one path a
user actually needs, when they need it.

## 3. Transitive peer discovery

How does Alice come to receive manifests from nodes she never paired with? Via
transitive discovery, authorized by a **mutual pairing**. See
[diagrams/02-pairing-transitive-discovery.svg](../diagrams/02-pairing-transitive-discovery.svg).

- **Pairing.** Pairing is **handshake-mandatory and always mutual**. Scanning a
  `myco://pair/<base64>` card (carrying `{ npub, name, pairSecret }`; no MAC/PSM —
  those are learned over BLE adverts) does not merely grant fetch access: it
  initiates the **invite-pairing handshake** against the inviter's on-device
  `<npub>.fips` endpoint — the scanner echoes `pairSecret` back over that
  Noise-encrypted channel and the inviter confirms — and completion makes **both**
  devices a source for the other. The one-time `pairSecret` (a long random string)
  authenticates the handshake but grants no membership or admin authority. A device's npub *is* its FIPS address, so once
  paired Alice can reach Ben's relay (`:4870`) and Blossom (`:24243`) over the
  mesh. This invite-pairing handshake ([identity-pairing.md § 6.1](../core/identity-pairing.md))
  is the **only** pairing path. (The device key is only ever a mesh/relay address;
  never an nsite author key.)
- **Mutual pairing = authorization.** A mutual pairing authorizes Alice to **poll
  Ben's collected peer list**. Ben, in effect, introduces his peers to Alice.
- **Transitive reach.** Having learned Ben's peers (Carl, Dana, …), Alice can
  now receive the manifests they hold and pull from them multi-hop over FIPS —
  even though she paired only with Ben. Reach grows along the pairing graph, not
  just the radio neighbourhood.

This is the social analogue of bitchat's neighbour-gossip TLV
(bitchat's implementation),
where a node advertises which peers it is directly connected to. Myco adapts
the idea to *authorized* polling of a curated peer list rather than unsolicited
topology gossip — pairing is the consent gate.

Because every pairing is now mutual (handshake-mandatory), the **authorization to
poll a paired peer's list exists in v1** — the consent gate is the completed
handshake. The poll *mechanism* itself can still land later.

**TBD / open:** the exact authorization mechanism. Is "Ben lets Alice poll his
list" enforced (e.g. Ben only answers a peer-list query from npubs he has
paired), advisory, or transitive-by-degree (can Alice reach Dana's peers too, or
does reach stop at one hop past a pairing)? How is a pairing revoked, and does
revocation prune transitively-learned peers?

## 4. Why any source is trustworthy

Transitive, multi-source propagation is only safe because **the data is
self-authenticating** and integrity is independent of the path it took:

- **Signed events.** The nsite manifest event is signed by the *author's*
  external key (held off-device by whoever authored the site). Carl checks
  Alice's signature on Alice's manifest; Ben — a holder, not the author — cannot
  forge or tamper with it in transit, and never possesses Alice's secret key.
- **Content-addressed blobs.** Blossom blobs are addressed by sha256 (BUD-01).
  Carl recomputes the hash of every blob he receives and matches it against the
  path→hash entry in the signed manifest.

So Carl can verify Alice's site is authentic *even though it arrived via Ben* —
exactly the property the bottom band of
[diagrams/03-offline-propagation.svg](../diagrams/03-offline-propagation.svg)
states: "the data carries its own integrity, independent of the path it took."
This is what makes "become a new source" sound: any cache is as trustworthy as
the origin, because trust is in the keys and the hashes, not in the relay.

It also bounds the threat model: a malicious relay can *withhold* or *delay*
content, but cannot *corrupt* it without detection. Verification is mandatory on
the receive path — content that fails signature or hash checks is dropped, never
cached, never re-served.

## 5. Dedup and anti-loop

Multi-hop manifest flooding needs loop suppression and duplicate suppression, or
a small mesh will melt under re-broadcast storms. The pattern is adapted directly
from bitchat (reference only).

### TTL flood with bounded relay

Each flooded manifest carries a hop budget (3, §2). Forwarders decrement and
stop at zero. Probabilistic relay on large meshes (forward with probability
< 1 to thin redundant copies, as bitchat's `PacketRelayManager` does) is
**not built**: Circles are small and every member forwards.
A node never relays its own packets and never relays a packet already addressed
to it.

### Set-reconciliation sync (negentropy / NIP-77), not blind reflooding

For steady-state convergence between neighbours, Myco uses **negentropy
([NIP-77](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/77.md)) set
reconciliation** — the Nostr-native, range-based protocol (`NEG-OPEN` / `NEG-MSG` /
`NEG-CLOSE`): two connected relays exchange compact range fingerprints and converge
on exactly "which **events** does each side hold that the other lacks" in ~log
bandwidth, then each pulls only its missing manifests. It is strictly local
(neighbour-to-neighbour, not relayed), so it converges content between directly
connected nodes without wide-area flooding. We pick the Nostr-native NIP-77 over
bitchat's `REQUEST_SYNC` **Golomb-Coded Set** digest (the conceptual reference,
bitchat's implementation)
because Myco's units are Nostr events and the `negentropy` Rust crate already ships
in the rust-nostr stack — we are not bitchat-wire-compatible anyway. **Blobs are not
reconciled**: they stay content-addressed pull-by-sha256.

**Cadence (the Plumtree lazy-pull).** Reconcile runs (a) **eagerly when a peer first
connects** — a one-shot catch-up, mirroring the *cadence* of bitchat's unicast
`REQUEST_SYNC` ~5 s after a new neighbour is seen (the timing, not its GCS wire) —
and (b) **periodically** at a slow neighbour-local
cadence (bitchat uses ~30 s, bounded to ~100 recent items). Both are strictly local,
never relayed. Exact intervals and bounds over FIPS L2CAP are tunable (open questions).

- **Dedup / seen-set IDs: 16-byte (128-bit) SHA-256 prefixes**, mirroring
  bitchat's `PacketIdUtil` (ID = first 16 bytes of SHA-256 over the canonical
  bytes). These drive the TTL-flood **seen-set** (loop/dup suppression for the
  fanout), *not* the negentropy filter — negentropy reconciles manifest events
  only (above):
  - manifests → first 16 bytes of the Nostr event `id` (itself a SHA-256 of the
    canonical serialization); this 16-byte prefix is the fanout seen-set element,
    while negentropy itself reconciles over the full event ids.
  - blobs → the blob's sha256 (already content-addressed) — used to **pull** and
    to track what's held, **never** as a reconciliation/filter element (blobs are
    not reconciled; see above).
- **Dedup.** A node maintains a rolling "seen" set of these IDs and never
  re-processes or re-floods an ID already in the set — the same role bitchat's
  seen-set plays, which is what makes TTL flood terminate.
- **Anti-loop.** TTL bounds the worst case; the seen-set kills cycles before TTL
  runs out. Source-route loops (a packet whose recorded path revisits a node)
  are dropped, mirroring the duplicate-hop check in `PacketRelayManager`.
- **Replaceable-event dedup.** nsite kind `35128` is parameterized-replaceable
  (`d` tag). As bitchat keeps only the latest ANNOUNCE per peer, Myco keeps
  only the newest manifest per `(author, dTag)` in the sync candidate set and
  supersedes older ones.

**Original events are forwarded unmodified** so author signatures stay valid —
the same rule bitchat applies to ANNOUNCE. Re-serializing would break the
signature and defeat §4.

## 6. Cache retention and LRU eviction

Caching is what turns a node into a new source, so retention policy *is*
propagation policy. Proposed defaults (vetoable):

- **LRU cache, default cap 2 GB** of blobs + retained events.
- **Pinned sites are exempt from eviction.** A site the user adds to their Library
  is pinned and kept indefinitely; the user's Library is their guaranteed
  serve-set.
- **Eviction.** When the cache exceeds cap, evict least-recently-used *unpinned*
  content. An evicted site is simply no longer served (or re-emitted) by this
  node; it can be re-pulled later from any other source that still has it.
- **Retention horizon for forwarded metadata.** bitchat's store-and-forward uses
  a 12h cache for relayed messages and ages out stale records
  (bitchat's implementation).
  Myco's analogue: a node stops re-emitting a manifest it no longer holds,
  and re-flood of a given manifest is soft-state; cached *content* lifetime is
  governed by LRU + pinning above, not by a fixed timeout.

**TBD / open:** does pinning a site also pin everything its manifest references
transitively (e.g. blobs referenced by the manifest are obviously pinned, but
what about sub-resources fetched lazily)? Per-site cap vs global cap? Whether the
2 GB default holds on low-storage devices.

## 7. Boundary restated

To be unambiguous, because this is the most common point of confusion:

- **FIPS / `fips-core` provides:** encrypted, multi-hop, live-path delivery
  between online nodes. Nothing in this document's announce/pull/cache/sync
  behaviour comes from FIPS.
- **Myco's relay + nsite layer provides:** everything in §§2–6 — the
  manifest flood (driven by the **nsite-deck propagator**, not the plain NIP-01
  `myco-relay` store), the on-demand blob pull and eager pinned-refresh (also the
  propagator), transitive discovery, dedup/anti-loop, and the cache that makes a
  node a re-serving source. This is the layer that "survives a partition."

If a future reader is tempted to "just add store-and-forward to FIPS," the
answer is no: it belongs here, at the layer where the data is self-authenticating
and a cache is a first-class source.

## Open questions

- **Privacy of "which manifests do I replicate."** Re-emitting an author's
  manifest reveals which sites a device is willing to serve, which leaks
  reading/caching interests to anyone within the 5-hop TTL radius. **TBD /
  open:** can a user propagate without making the set of manifests they replicate
  observable under their own (device) identity? Options to weigh: flood only to
  paired peers, anonymous/aggregate hints, or opt-in "I am a public re-server"
  mode. This trades propagation reach against metadata privacy and is unresolved.
  Note this is purely about *which already-signed manifests a holder chooses to
  replicate* — no holder-authored event is involved.
- **Optimistic sharing vs. spam / chatter.** Eagerly fanning out *every* manifest
  you hold maximizes discovery but risks flooding the mesh with chatter — the fine
  line. Levers to weigh: scope the eager flood to your **circle / Library /
  recently-touched** manifests rather than everything held; TTL + dedup seen-set;
  **probabilistic relay** on larger meshes; a **recent-N retention bound** on what
  you re-announce (bitchat caps sync to ~100 recent); rate-limiting; and possibly
  **interest-based fanout** (only push a manifest a peer signalled interest in).
  Where to sit on the optimistic↔conservative axis is **TBD / open**.
- **Transitive authorization depth & revocation.** See §3 — how far past a single
  pairing does reach extend, and how is a pairing (and its transitively-learned
  peers) revoked?
- **Sync scope & cost on BLE.** Negentropy (NIP-77) reconcile cadence and
  `NEG-MSG` round size may need different parameters over FIPS L2CAP than over
  bitchat's GATT links; **TBD / open** pending the two-device demo.
- **nsite-scoped propagation (capability-gated).** A loaded nsite might want to
  widen what gets gossiped — e.g. a kind-1 client nsite asking the propagator to
  also reconcile/forward kind-1 notes. But nsites are **untrusted, sandboxed
  content**, so this can only ever be a **bounded, permissioned capability**, not
  an open door. The propagator's subscribed kinds/filters are the natural control
  point: **default-deny**, with explicit limits on kinds, rate, storage, and scope,
  gated behind user consent. **TBD / open:** the capability's exact shape and
  enforcement. See [security.md § 5](../core/security.md),
  [nsite-layer.md § 7](./nsite-layer.md), and the roadmap "nsite capability API"
  item.
