# The nsite Layer: Embedded Relay, Blossom, and Gateway

This document is the **content layer** of Myco: the embedded Nostr relay,
the embedded Blossom blob server, and the in-process gateway that turns an
author's `npub` into a browsable "app" in the WebView. Myco never
authors, signs, or publishes nsites itself; it **stores, serves, and replicates**
sites that were authored *elsewhere* by external nsite tooling. It is the layer
that makes `http://<npub_author>.localhost` resolve to a static site, fetching that
site's already-signed manifest and content-addressed blobs from a reachable peer
over FIPS the first time, then serving it from a local cache forever after —
including fully offline.

It mirrors the model of the Go **nsite-deck** reference (its `sync-architecture.md`
and `nsite-protocol.md`; not checked into this repo), re-implemented in Rust and
re-pointed at Circle members over FIPS instead of public relays.

> Status: built. Two things differ from the design as first written: the
> WebView host is `<host>.localhost`, not `<host>.nsite` (§3.2), and the
> gateway is in-process — `shouldInterceptRequest` → `gatewayGet` — rather than
> a bound HTTP server (§4). Section headings that say "proposed" describe what
> shipped unless marked otherwise.
>
> **Deprecated — the mesh ports (§5).** Pulling a site from a holder by dialling
> their relay and Blossom over `.fips` (`<npub>.fips:4870` / `:24243`) works
> today and will be **removed in a future version**, for both servers. Sync
> between Circle members moves to a channel the Circle layer owns
> ([circle.md](../circle/circle.md)); the relay and store stop being sockets
> a peer can dial. §5 describes what ships now; nothing new should depend on
> it.

### The crate workspace

The native library is built from **four crates**, split along **reuse
boundaries** so the genuinely reusable piece stays free of any particular relay,
blob store, or radio:

- **`nsite-deck`** *(reusable core)* — the app-agnostic **nsite host**: the
  gateway (§3) and the sync engine (§2.4). This is the genuinely novel,
  reusable know-how — manifest resolution (kind 15128/35128 → `path → sha256`),
  serving an nsite under `<host>.localhost`, and orchestrating sync. It must know
  **nothing** about FIPS, BLE, Android, *or* any concrete relay/Blossom: it is
  "an embedded nsite host" and no more.
- **`myco-relay`** *(reusable primitive)* — a generic embedded Nostr relay: the
  event store + the `ws://localhost:4870` server. Useful to any Nostr app.
- **`myco-blossom`** *(reusable primitive)* — a generic embedded Blossom blob
  store: the content-addressed store + the `http://localhost:24243` server.
  Useful to anything that needs Blossom (notably: there is **no good Android
  Blossom app**, which is exactly why this is worth having standalone).
- **`myco-core`** *(app crate)* — the thin Myco-specific glue: the FIPS
  endpoint, `AndroidBleIo`, the JNI-JSON FFI reducer, identity/pairing, and the
  wiring that picks which backends to plug in.

`nsite-deck` reaches everything outside itself through **four trait seams**,
mirroring how `fips-core` abstracts its radio behind `BleIo`:

- **storage seams** (provided by `myco-relay` / `myco-blossom`):
  - **`RelayBackend`** — store/query manifest events. The default is the embedded
    `myco-relay`; **Citrine-forward is just an alternate `RelayBackend`** (§2.1).
  - **`BlobStore`** — `get` / `has` / `put` blobs by sha256, backed by
    `myco-blossom` (§2.2).
- **transport seams** (provided by `myco-core` over FIPS):
  - **`PeerSource`** — *pull / reconcile*: `fetch_manifest(author, dTag)`,
    `fetch_blob(sha256)`, and `reconcile(filter)` (negentropy / NIP-77 set
    reconciliation — see §2.4) against some reachable source. The sync engine
    (§2.4) calls these; it does not care *how* the bytes arrive.
  - **`FanoutSink`** — *push*: `broadcast(event)` to connected peers. The
    **nsite-deck propagator** (§2.1) drives this — it subscribes to the relevant
    relays and re-publishes accepted manifests to peer relays; the seam does not
    know who the peers are or what carries the bytes. The relay itself never
    fans out (it is a plain NIP-01 store + socket).

So `myco-core` is the only crate that names FIPS *or* a concrete relay/Blossom: it
instantiates `myco-relay` + `myco-blossom`, hands them to `nsite-deck` as the
`RelayBackend` / `BlobStore`, implements `PeerSource` / `FanoutSink` over FIPS, and
binds the relay/Blossom ports into the mesh (`<npub>.fips:4870` / `:24243`). All
four crates cross-compile into the single `libmyco_core.so`. Kotlin owns the radio
and the TUN; Rust owns the content layer and the mesh. See
[diagrams/01-system-layering.svg](../diagrams/01-system-layering.svg) and
[diagrams/05-nsite-layer-architecture.svg](../diagrams/05-nsite-layer-architecture.svg).

> **Why relay + Blossom are their own crates.** A Nostr relay and a Blossom
> server are generic primitives — nothing about them is nsite-specific — so
> keeping them *out* of `nsite-deck` is what lets `nsite-deck` stay a clean,
> reusable nsite host, and lets the relay/Blossom be reused on their own. The
> cost is two more crates in the workspace; each boundary is one the pluggable
> backend already needed, so none of it is speculative.

> **Why Rust, not Go.** The reference nsite-deck is Go (Khatru relay +
> Khatru/Blossom). The locked decision is to re-implement relay + Blossom in
> Rust (as `myco-relay` / `myco-blossom`) so there is **one** cross-compiled
> `.so` and **one** FFI surface, rather than embedding a second Go runtime. The
> Go reference remains the behavioural spec; the Rust port must match its wire
> behaviour (kinds, manifest tags, URL scheme).

> **Naming note.** The `nsite-deck` crate shares the name *nsite-deck* with the
> Go reference project it descends from; they are different codebases (Go
> reference vs. our Rust crate). **TBD / open** whether to publish it under a
> less overloaded crate name.

## 2. The Rust implementation

> §2.1 and §2.2 describe what is built. Items marked **planned** or **not built**
> are still proposals; the load-bearing requirement is the *behaviour*, not the
> dependency.

### 2.1 The relay: a proxy in front of a swappable store

Two components, deliberately separated.

**The mesh relay proxy** ([`myco-core/src/mesh_relay.rs`](../../../myco-core/src/mesh_relay.rs))
is the NIP-01 WebSocket front door. It serves the in-app WebView on
`ws://localhost:4870` and mesh peers on `ws://[fd00::self]:4870`, and it is the
only Myco-specific code on the content path: origin classification, the gossip
seen-set, hop-budget stamping and clamping, split-horizon, pull fan-out, live
subscription mirroring, and the circle access gate all live here.

**The store** ([`myco-relay`](../../../myco-relay/src/lib.rs)) is a plain NIP-01
event store behind it. It holds **no Myco concepts** — no mesh, no ttl, no
circles — and it has no socket of its own. It is the default backend, not "our
relay".

#### The two boundaries

| Link | Protocol |
| --- | --- |
| nsite ↔ `ws://localhost:4870` | Plain NIP-01. No Myco verb, no Myco key, ever. |
| proxy ↔ backing store | Plain NIP-01. This is what lets any relay sit there. |
| proxy ↔ proxy over `.fips` | Plain NIP-01 or a `MESH` envelope ([event-gossip.md §2](../core/event-gossip.md)) |

Concentrating the Myco-specific behaviour on the one link nobody else listens on
is what makes the store replaceable. A `MESH` frame arriving on the loopback
socket is refused with a `NOTICE`.

#### The backend seam

`nsite-deck`'s [`RelayBackend`](../../../nsite-deck/src/seams.rs) is the seam, and it
is cut around the verbs every relay already speaks: `publish`, and `query` over
real `nostr::Filter`s. Using real filters rather than a hand-rolled subset means
`since`, `until`, ids, and general tag matching all work, and a remote backend
needs no translation layer. "Newest event in a replaceable slot" is a helper over
`query`, not a backend method, because it is an ordinary filter.

Operations with **no NIP-01 expression** — the selective cache wipe that keeps
pinned sites — live in a separate `AdminBackend` trait that only the embedded
store implements. Where it is absent the operation is skipped, and the Storage
screen says so: with a custom store configured, Delete states that it clears this
device only and leaves the custom store alone. Claiming otherwise would be a lie
about a destructive action.

**Built.** [`RemoteBackend`](../../../myco-core/src/remote_backend.rs) speaks
WebSocket to a configured relay URL — [Citrine](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Citrine)
on the same device, a `strfry` or `nostr-rs-relay` on the LAN. It holds one
connection open and multiplexes publishes and queries over it by subscription id;
an unreachable relay is an error rather than an empty result, because an empty
set would render as a missing site.

The URL lives under **Settings → Storage → Advanced**, persisted in
`settings.json` and read at startup, since the backend is chosen when the content
layer is constructed. Changing it therefore applies on the next launch, and the
app offers to restart. Citrine has been confirmed working as the store.

Two things the settings screen says when a custom backend is configured:

- **We stop verifying what comes back out.** Signatures are checked once, at
  ingress; reads from the backend are trusted because NIP-01 already requires a
  relay to verify what it accepts. Pointing Myco at someone else's relay means
  trusting that relay, and any other writer it has.
- **NIP-40 expiry is not guaranteed.** The proxy drops expired events on the way
  out; unbounded growth inside someone else's relay is their operator's problem.

The Go reference uses [Khatru](https://github.com/fiatjaf/khatru) over a BoltDB
event store and advertises NIPs 1, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 33
(`embedded.go` (nsite-deck reference)). Still
wanted, net-new vs. the Go reference: **negentropy
([NIP-77](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/77.md))**
(`NEG-OPEN` / `NEG-MSG` / `NEG-CLOSE`) for set reconciliation (§2.4), which for an
external backend becomes a capability to detect rather than something we can
assume.

**Patterns in use:**

- rust-nostr's LMDB store ([`nostr-lmdb`](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr))
  for durable events: indexed NIP-01 queries, replaceable/addressable slot
  dedup and NIP-09 deletions applied by the database, one small ACID write per
  event, mmap reads. It replaced a JSON file that was rewritten whole on every
  event once napplets started publishing and pulling notes into the store; it
  also brings negentropy (NIP-77) items for P3. Events with a NIP-40
  `expiration` — chat — stay in memory and never touch disk, by design.
- The same `nostr` crate for signature verification, NIP-19 (`npub`)
  encode/decode, and the relay-message wire format.
- `axum` handlers for the proxy's WebSocket sockets, the Blossom HTTP routes, and
  the auth service, all sharing one Tokio runtime with the FIPS endpoint.

**Replaceable-event semantics matter.** Kind `15128` is replaceable (one per
pubkey); kind `35128` is parameterized-replaceable (one per `(pubkey, d-tag)`).
The store MUST keep only the newest event per slot, matching the dedup the Go
sync does by `(kind, d-tag)`
(`service.go `deduplicateManifests`` (nsite-deck reference)).

**Fanout to connected peers.** The store never fans out. Fanout is the proxy's
gossiper: when an event is accepted for the first time, it is published onward to
every circle peer except the one it came from, as a `MESH`-wrapped `["EVENT", …]`
to each `<peer>.fips:4870`. This is what makes the "announce widely" half of
propagation push-based and automatic instead of a flood the app has to
orchestrate (see [./propagation.md §2](./propagation.md)). Constraints:

- **Events fan out; blobs do not.** Only Nostr events (in practice the small,
  self-authenticating manifests) are multiplexed. Blossom blobs are *not* events
  and stay **pull-only** — fanning megabytes to N peers would saturate a BLE
  link.
- **Source-excluded + de-duplicated.** The proxy's own seen-set, keyed by event
  id, plus a hop budget (default 3) prevents echoing an event back to its sender
  or re-flooding one already forwarded. The seen-set is the proxy's, **not** the
  store's, so an id the store GCs at expiry does not look new again
  ([event-gossip.md §4](../core/event-gossip.md)).
- **Re-emitted unmodified.** Forwarded events keep the author's signature intact
  and are byte-for-byte canonical NIP-01; the hop budget rides beside them in the
  envelope. Forwarding an already-signed event is normal publish behaviour, not
  authoring.

See [diagrams/07-relay-mesh-fanout.svg](../diagrams/07-relay-mesh-fanout.svg).

### 2.2 Blossom: the same layering, one implementation so far

A content-addressed blob server on `http://localhost:24243` and
`http://[fd00::self]:24243` — the **`myco-blossom`** crate, implementing
`nsite-deck`'s `BlobStore` seam. It serves the
[BUD-01](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/01.md) surface the
gateway and sync need:

- `GET /<sha256>` → blob bytes (+ `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`).
- `PUT /upload` → store blob, key by `sha256(body)`.
- `HEAD /<sha256>` → existence check.

**No protocol fork anywhere on the blob plane.** There is no ttl, no gossip, and
no query semantics on blobs, so nothing needs a `MESH` envelope. Peers speak
plain BUD-01 to us and we speak plain BUD-01 to the store. This is the one plane
where both boundaries *and* the peer link are stock protocol.

**Access, but no Myco knowledge in the crate.** The mesh-facing port is gated:
loopback bypasses, and a mesh source must pass an access function supplied by
`myco-core`, which answers from the circle and the peer's own permissions
([nsite-permissions.md §2](./nsite-permissions.md)). The gate distinguishes reads
from uploads, so `myco-blossom` stays a generic store that knows nothing about
circles.

**Two implementations.** The filesystem store described here is the default;
[`RemoteBlobStore`](../../../myco-core/src/remote_blobs.rs) reads through to an
external Blossom server over BUD-01, with kind-24242 upload authorization signed
by the device key and **hash verification on every read** (the embedded store can
skip re-hashing because the only way bytes get in is a verified write; a shared
store cannot, so bytes that do not match the requested hash are treated as
absent).

With a custom server configured the mesh Blossom listener on `:24243` is **not
bound at all**: it exists to serve our own blobs to peers, and there are none —
peers reach that server by its own URL rather than through us.

Not yet exercised against a third-party Blossom implementation. The settings
screen carries two warnings sharper than the relay's:

- **A remote backend breaks offline-first.** Blobs are the bulk of an nsite, so
  pointing this at an internet server means a peer pulling an app from us needs
  *our* internet connection. A Blossom app on the same device, or one on the LAN,
  is fine.
- **Every gateway blob read becomes a round trip.** Today it is a file read. An
  nsite with many assets pays that per request.

The Go reference stores blobs as files named by their hash under a `blobs/` dir,
with a BoltDB metadata index, and **disables auth** for the local server
(`embedded.go` (nsite-deck reference)). The Rust
port keeps the storage shape: blobs on the filesystem keyed by sha256, no auth on
localhost. Blobs are immutable and self-authenticating (the hash *is* the
identity), so the store needs no per-blob signature check — only a
`sha256(bytes) == name` verify on write.

### 2.3 The gateway

An HTTP server on localhost that the WebView talks to. It does host resolution,
the cache hit/miss decision, the loading page, and (on miss) drives the sync
engine. This is the Go `gateway` package
(`handlers.go` (nsite-deck reference)),
re-implemented in Rust. The request lifecycle is §4.

### 2.4 The sync engine

Pulls a manifest + its blobs from a source, verifies every blob's sha256, and
mirrors them into the **local Blossom + relay** so the gateway can serve them
direct (§4). The Go reference is
`service.go` (nsite-deck reference); two Myco
changes: **the source** is a reachable FIPS peer instead of public
relays/Blossom (§5), and v0 **does not** build version directories or do an
atomic swap — it serves direct from the content-addressed store, deferring the
reference's htdocs/version-dir machinery to the roadmap (§4.4).

**Set reconciliation (negentropy / NIP-77).** Rather than blindly re-pulling a
peer's full manifest set, the sync engine reconciles **event** sets with a
connected peer using **negentropy ([NIP-77](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/77.md))**
— range-based reconciliation that settles "which manifests do you have that I
don't" in ~log bandwidth, which matters on a constrained BLE link. It runs over the
peer's relay (`NEG-OPEN` on a manifest filter → `NEG-MSG` rounds → the missing
ids), then the diff is fetched as usual; **blobs stay content-addressed
pull-by-sha256 and are not part of reconciliation**. The `negentropy` Rust crate is
already in the rust-nostr dependency graph (used by `nostr-relay-pool`), so this is
a proven dependency, not new R&D. This is the **pull / catch-up** counterpart to the
push-based propagator fanout (§2.1): the propagator gossips newly-accepted manifests
live; negentropy reconciles whatever was missed while disconnected or on first
contact. A basic reconcile lands in **roadmap P3** (alongside fanout); scale
hardening is **P5**.

## 3. The manifest model and URL scheme

### 3.1 Manifest

An nsite is described by a single **manifest event** — a signed Nostr event
whose tags map absolute paths to blob hashes. There is no separate per-file
event (that was the legacy kind `34128` model; Myco does not use it).

- **Root site** — kind `15128`, no `d` tag. One replaceable event per pubkey.
- **Named site** — kind `35128`, with a `d` tag = site identifier. One per
  `(pubkey, d-tag)`. Think of these as sub-apps under one identity.

Each path is a tag of the form:

```
["path", "/index.html", "<sha256-of-the-file>"]
```

Optional tags: `["server", "<blossom-url>"]` (hints — Myco largely ignores
these in favour of peer Blossom, see §5), `["title", …]`, `["description", …]`,
`["source", "<repo-url>"]`. The site icon is whatever the manifest maps at
`/favicon.ico`.

Full tag layout and a worked example: [../reference/nostr-kinds.md](../../reference/nostr-kinds.md).
The site → manifest → blobs data model is drawn in [diagrams/06-nsite-data-model.svg](../diagrams/06-nsite-data-model.svg).
Protocol source: the nsite-deck reference's `nsite-protocol.md` (not checked in).

### 3.2 URL scheme — host is the identity

The site is addressed entirely by its hostname; there is no URL bar and the path
component behaves like any static host.

| Site type | Host label |
| --- | --- |
| Root | `npub1…` (NIP-19 bech32 of the author pubkey) |
| Named | `<pubkeyB36><dTag>` — 50-char base36 pubkey directly followed by the d-tag |

`pubkeyB36` is the raw 32-byte pubkey in lowercase base36, always exactly 50
characters; `dTag` matches `^[a-z0-9-]{1,13}$` and must not end with `-`. The
50+13 fits inside a single 63-char DNS label, avoiding wildcard-cert and
multi-level-subdomain problems. The Go encoder/decoder and the matching regex
are in `base36.go` (nsite-deck reference); the
Rust port reproduces them exactly.

**Host suffix.** Myco serves under `<host>.localhost`. The WebView never
resolves it: every request is intercepted and answered in-process.
The browser reaches the localhost gateway over IPv4 — which is why it works in
**any** WebView including Chromium, where IPv6-only `.fips` resolution is
suppressed. The browser **never** resolves `.fips`; only the native sync engine
does (§5, and [../reference/ports.md](../../reference/ports.md)).

**Resolution into a `siteKey`.** The gateway strips the host suffix and resolves
the leading label(s) into `(npub, identifier)`, then forms a cache key —
`"npub"` for root sites, `"npub:identifier"` for named sites (the same
`npub:dTag` convention used for the manifest slot in
[../reference/nostr-kinds.md](../../reference/nostr-kinds.md)). The Go
`resolveStem` walks alias chains and canonical named-site labels with a depth
bound (`handlers.go` (nsite-deck reference));
the Rust port keeps the same logic. An unresolvable host bounces the browser to
the Library UI's "not in your Library" page rather than surfacing a raw error.

> **Host suffix — `.localhost`.** The design first locked `<host>.nsite`,
> served by a `*.nsite → 127.0.0.1` DNS interceptor. It moved to
> `<host>.localhost` for one reason: Chromium treats `*.localhost` as loopback
> and a **secure context**, so a page may open `ws://localhost:4870` to the
> embedded relay; a `.nsite` page is classed "public" and Local Network Access
> blocks that connection. The `.nsite` TLD is not used by the app.

---

## 4. The gateway flow: resolve → manifest → blob → serve

The browse-request lifecycle, per
[diagrams/04-nsite-browse-flow.svg](../diagrams/04-nsite-browse-flow.svg).

> **v0 serves DIRECT from the local relay + Blossom.** There are no version
> directories, no `current/` pointer, and no atomic swap in v0. Each request
> resolves the manifest from the local relay, maps `<path> → sha256`, fetches
> that blob from the local Blossom, and serves it with a content-type inferred
> from the path extension. The reference's path-named **htdocs** serving cache
> (write blobs out as files under a `current/` dir) is a **later speed
> optimization, deferred to the roadmap** — not the v0 serving model (§4.4).

### 4.1 Resolve and normalize

1. WebView requests `http://<host>.localhost/<path>`; `shouldInterceptRequest`
   hands it to the in-process gateway.
2. Gateway resolves `host → (npub, identifier) → siteKey`.
3. Normalize the path: `/` and any directory path fall back to
   `…/index.html`; an extensionless path is treated as a directory. (Matches the
   spec's index fallback.)

### 4.2 Serve direct from the content-addressed store — the v0 path

If the site's manifest is in the local relay, serve the requested path direct,
per request:

1. **Look up the manifest event** for `siteKey` in the local relay
   (kind `15128` / `35128`, newest per slot).
2. **Map `<path> → sha256`** from the manifest's `["path", …, <sha256>]` tags.
3. **Fetch that blob** from the local Blossom by hash (`GET /<sha256>`).
4. **Serve it** with a `Content-Type` **inferred from the path extension** (the
   manifest is path→hash only; the extension is the type signal), plus
   `Content-Length`. Update the last-accessed timestamp for LRU.

If the path is not in the manifest, fall back to the site's `/404.html`, then a
gateway 404.

**"All referenced blobs present?" check.** Before serving a site, the gateway
verifies that **every** blob the manifest references is present in the local
Blossom (a `HEAD /<sha256>` per tag, or an index lookup). If any are missing the
site is **still syncing** — the gateway shows the loading page (§4.3) rather than
serving a half-present site. Once all referenced blobs are present the site is
servable direct, instantly, with no further network — including fully offline.

### 4.3 Manifest missing or site incomplete — fetch, then serve

If the manifest is absent, or the "all blobs present?" check fails, the gateway
runs a single-flight sync (`startOrJoinSync`: at most one sync per `siteKey`,
late requests join the in-flight one), then:

- **Sync completes within ~1s** → serve direct (§4.2).
- **Sync takes longer than ~1s** → return a **loading page** (HTTP 503 with a
  spinner) that subscribes to the local relay for the manifest (to show
  title/description as soon as it arrives) and polls a status endpoint; the page
  renders the status copy below and, when the status flips to `ready` (manifest
  stored + all referenced blobs present), redirects to the real content. This is
  the `writeLoadingPage` / `handleLoadingStatus` pair in the reference.

The status endpoint returns the FFI `siteStatus` shape (`{ state, filesPulled,
filesTotal, message }`, see [../reference/ffi-surface.md](../../reference/ffi-surface.md)).
The loading/error page renders one row per state, with the exact user-facing copy
and action:

| `state` | Page copy | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `syncing` | `Getting <title>… <n>/<total> files` | none (progress) |
| `unreachable` | `Can't reach anyone who has this app yet. Bring the device you got it from nearby, then Retry.` | **Retry** |
| `incomplete` | `This app didn't download completely. Try again.` | **Retry**; abort the sync and do **not** cache (matches §5.2 step 4 verify) |
| unknown host / not in Library | — | bounce the browser to the Library "not in your Library" page (§3.2) |

The 1-second threshold and the poll-then-redirect loading page are taken
directly from the reference and are a **proposed default** (tunable).

### 4.4 Deferred: the htdocs serving cache

## 5. Sync over FIPS: pulling a manifest + blobs from a peer

> **Deprecated.** This section describes the mesh ports — dialling a holder's

> removal; see the note at the top and [circle.md](../circle/circle.md).

This is the one place Myco diverges substantially from nsite-deck. The Go
sync engine fetches from **public** relays/Blossom over the internet; Myco
fetches from a **reachable FIPS peer** over the mesh — including offline over
BLE.

**Source resolution order.** For any missing event or blob, Myco tries sources in
this order, stopping at the first hit:

1. **Local relay + Blossom** — already held; serve direct (§4.2), no fetch.
2. **FIPS peers** — a reachable holder over `.fips` (your circle and, transitively,
   their peers; §5.1–5.2). The offline mesh path.
3. **Servers/relays the nsite event lists** — the manifest's `["server", …]` hints
   plus the author's NIP-65 `10002` relay list / BUD-03 `10063` Blossom servers.
   This is the **online fallback** (needs IP internet), so it is the **last resort**
   — and the Dev tab's **Offline only** switch (`set_offline_only`, see
   [settings.md](../../reference/settings.md)) disables it entirely so Myco
   never reaches the IP internet (tiers 1–2 only).

### 5.1 Reaching the holder's services over `.fips`

**Two different keys.** The site you want is identified by its **author** key
(`npub_author`, the URL host) — an external key Myco never holds the
secret for and never signs with. The peer you *fetch it from* is a **holder**:
any device that has cached and re-serves the author's signed manifest + blobs.
Each holder is reachable at its own **device** key, `npub_holder`, which is that
device's one Nostr keypair (used for the FIPS mesh address, BLE link auth, and as
the address of its relay+Blossom — never to author nsites). These are not the
same key: the author identifies *what* you want, the holder identifies *who you
get it from*.

A holder is reachable at the mesh address
`fd00:: = fd + SHA256(npub_holder)[0:15]`, and the `.fips` DNS interceptor maps
`<npub_holder>.fips → fd00::` (AAAA). Because FIPS multiplexes mesh datagrams to
localhost ports (the IPv6 adapter runs on FSP port 256, and `curl
http://<npub>.fips:port/` already works in the FIPS Android reference), the
holder's own relay and Blossom are reachable at:

- `ws://<npub_holder>.fips:4870` — the holder's embedded relay
- `http://<npub_holder>.fips:24243` — the holder's embedded Blossom

You then query that holder's relay *for the author's events*:
`{ kinds:[15128 or 35128], authors:[<author_pubkey>] }`. The holder serves the
author's already-signed manifest unmodified; it is not the author of anything it
re-serves.

No separate gateway port is needed on a reachable path — the localhost services
*are* the mesh endpoints. Sources:
[../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-session-layer.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-session-layer.md)
and [../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-ipv6-adapter.md](../../../reference/fips/docs/design/fips-ipv6-adapter.md).

> **Note.** The *sync engine* (native Rust) is what dials `<npub>.fips`. The
> WebView never does. See [../reference/ports.md](../../reference/ports.md) for the
> exact `.fips` vs `.localhost` split.

### 5.2 The pull sequence

For a `siteKey` authored by `npub_author`, fetched from a reachable holder
`npub_holder` (chosen from the manifests you have received / the Library; selection
is detailed in [./propagation.md](./propagation.md)):

1. **Fetch the manifest.** Query the holder's relay
   `ws://<npub_holder>.fips:4870` for the author's manifest event:
   - root: `{ "kinds":[15128], "authors":[<author_pubkey>] }`
   - named: `{ "kinds":[35128], "authors":[<author_pubkey>], "#d":[<identifier>] }`
   Keep the newest per slot.
2. **Build the file list.** Extract every `["path", <path>, <sha256>]` tag →
   `path → hash` map.
3. **Pull blobs by hash.** For each hash, `GET <sha256>` from the holder's Blossom
   `http://<npub_holder>.fips:24243`. Fetch concurrently (the reference caps at 8).
   Because blobs are content-addressed, Myco can prefer the **local**
   Blossom first (a blob already cached for another site is the same blob) and
   only go to the peer on a miss.
4. **Verify.** Re-hash each blob; `sha256(bytes)` MUST equal the manifest hash.
   Any mismatch or missing blob **aborts the whole sync**. This is what makes any
   source trustworthy: the data is self-authenticating, so it does not matter
   *who* served it.
5. **Mirror into local Blossom.** Store each verified blob (keyed by sha256) in
   the **local Blossom**, so this device can both serve it direct (§4.2) and
   re-serve it to the next peer — the propagation hop. No version dir is written
   in v0; the content-addressed store *is* the cache.
6. **Activate.** Store the author's signed manifest event (unmodified) into the
   **local** relay. With all referenced blobs now present (§4.2's check), the
   site is immediately servable direct; the stored manifest also lets the local
   relay answer the loading page's subscription. Re-emitting an already-signed
   event relay-to-relay like this is normal relay behaviour, not authoring — the
   author's signature stays valid.

Steps 1–6 mirror `Sync` in
`service.go` (nsite-deck reference), with public
relays/Blossom replaced by the single peer's `.fips` endpoints. The manifest's own
`["server", …]` hints (public Blossom URLs) are **tier 3** of the source-resolution
order above — the online fallback, used only when reachable and only if
`[sync] offline_only` is not set; on the offline mesh path they are skipped.

> **Open question — source selection & multi-source pull.** v1 pulls from one
> chosen holder. Pulling different blobs from different reachable holders in
> parallel (the data is content-addressed, so any holder will do) is a natural
> extension but is **TBD / open**. Manifest-driven source discovery lives in
> [./propagation.md](./propagation.md).

### 5.3 Why this is propagation, not just caching

FIPS transport gives **live-path multi-hop only** — there is no store-and-forward
in the mesh itself. The store-and-forward behaviour ("cache Alice's site and
re-serve it to Carl tomorrow, offline") is **net-new at this layer**: step 5
mirrors every blob and the manifest into the local relay + Blossom, so the
device *becomes a new holder* for that site. Carl syncing from this device sees
the exact same self-authenticating manifest and blobs that Alice (the external
author) signed — this device re-serving them does not make it the author. This is
the split the project calls the Pillars of Propagation; the policy around it
(announce widely the author-signed manifests, pull the blobs on demand) is
[./propagation.md](./propagation.md).

### 5.4 Eager refresh of pinned sites

Library-pinned sites are kept current in the background so they stay
offline-ready *before* the next open. The **nsite-deck propagator** (§2.1) keeps
an internal subscription for kinds **15128 / 35128** across the relays it is
connected to; when a **newer** manifest arrives for a Library-pinned
`(author, dTag)`, it **auto-runs the §5.2 pull in the background** — fetch the
manifest's blobs by hash from a reachable holder's `.fips` Blossom, verify each
sha256, and mirror the verified blobs + the signed manifest into the local
Blossom + relay. The pinned app is then up to date for the next open with no
foreground sync. This reuses the §5.2 sequence verbatim (including the
abort-on-mismatch verify, step 4); only the *trigger* differs — a newer manifest
seen on subscription rather than a browse request.

## 6. Offline serving from cache

Once a site has been synced — manifest in the local relay, all referenced blobs
in the local Blossom — it is served entirely from the local content-addressed
store and never needs the network again:

- **Cached site, offline** → served direct from the local relay + Blossom (§4.2),
  identical to the online path. The nsite opens and runs fully with no radio
  (any in-app reload/navigation it implements works against the local stores).
- **Uncached site, offline** → the sync has no reachable source, so the gateway
  shows the `unreachable` page (HTTP 503): *"Can't reach anyone who has this app
  yet. Bring the device you got it from nearby, then Retry."* with a **Retry**
  action (§4.3). It is not a crash; the moment a holding peer comes into BLE
  range, the retry succeeds.

This is the offline guarantee in
`sync-architecture.md` (nsite-deck reference): all
cached nsites work without network; only first-time/uncached sites need a
reachable source.

### Discovery: "nsites around me"

Beyond loading a known `<host>.localhost`, the Apps grid can surface sites that reachable
holders have. The set of discoverable sites is **the author-signed manifests this
device has** — those received via the flood (small, self-authenticating manifest
events re-emitted unmodified by relays) plus those **queried from every reachable
relay** (your own, plus each paired peer's relay at `<npub_holder>.fips:4870`,
plus their collected peers — see [./propagation.md](./propagation.md) for
transitive reach) for kinds **15128 / 35128**. Present them **newest-first,
de-duplicated by `(author, dTag)`**. Selecting one runs the normal §4 sync/serve
flow (fetching the large blobs on demand). This is exposed as a `SearchNsites`
FFI action ([../reference/ffi-surface.md](../../reference/ffi-surface.md)); ranking
beyond recency is **TBD / open**.

### Storage and eviction

**Two stores, kept distinct.** The **Blossom blob store** is the
content-addressed store Myco *retains*: blobs keyed by sha256, embedded from day
one, it is both the store-and-forward source (what this device re-serves to the
next peer) and what serving reads from direct (§4.2). The deferred **htdocs**
cache (§4.4) is a *derived*, path-named serving cache layered on top — a speed
optimization, never the source of truth, and not present in v0. The 2 GB cap
below governs the **Blossom blob store**.

- **LRU cache, default cap 2 GB** (proposed default), over the Blossom blob
  store. Oldest-accessed sites are evicted first when over cap, using a small
  SQLite index of `(siteKey, size, last_accessed)`
  (`cache/database.go` (nsite-deck reference),
  `cache/manager.go` (nsite-deck reference)).
- **Pinned sites are exempt.** A site the user adds to their Library is pinned and
  never evicted.
- **Blob dedup.** Because the local Blossom is content-addressed, a blob shared
  across sites (e.g. a common JS lib) is stored once and re-served to peers
  regardless of which site first pulled it.
- **Version retention (deferred).** Multi-version retention + GC belongs to the
  htdocs cache (§4.4); it is **not** part of the v0 serve-direct model.

---

## 7. Open questions

- **JS sandbox / capability API.** v1 nsites are **pure static content**. What
  an nsite's JavaScript may call back into (e.g. query reachable peers, trigger
  a sync) is a later milestone and an explicit open design question (called out
  on [diagram 04](../diagrams/04-nsite-browse-flow.svg)). The per-application
  capability model — gossip-kinds, TTL clamps, rate, location — is now sketched in
  [nsite-permissions.md](./nsite-permissions.md) (v1 default-allow, enforced via
  the WebSocket `Origin`). **TBD / open.**
- **htdocs serving cache** — the deferred path-named cache and its Android
  atomic-swap mechanism (symlink-rename vs `current.json` pointer file)
  (§4.4). **Deferred to the roadmap — TBD / open.**
- **Multi-source / parallel pull** from several reachable holders (§5.2).
  **TBD / open.**
- **Relay store choice** — full `nostr-rs-relay`-style store vs a hand-rolled
  `rusqlite` store sized to the tiny query surface Myco actually uses (§2.1).
  **TBD / open.**
- **nsite-scoped propagation (capability-gated)** — whether the propagator's
  fanout should be scoped per nsite / gated by a pairing capability rather than
  flooding every accepted manifest to every connected peer. Tracked in
  [./propagation.md](./propagation.md)'s "nsite-scoped propagation
  (capability-gated)" open question (ties into the mandatory mutual pairing
  handshake, identity-pairing §6.1). **TBD / open.**
