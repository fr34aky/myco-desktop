//! NAP-OUTBOX's two seams over Myco's world: relay plans from NIP-65 lists in
//! the local store, and lane I/O over the store, the Circle relay pool and the
//! internet.
//!
//! The three lanes are what make the outbox model work with no internet
//! (design §7.4): a kind 10002 can name `ws://<npub>.fips:4870` beside `wss://`
//! relays, and a napplet written for the open web reads a Circle member's
//! notes from their phone across the room by the same NIP-65 logic it would
//! use anywhere. A mesh lane is a directed connection to that one relay — the
//! relay model — never the Circle flood, which is NAP-MESH's.
//!
//! Policy, in one place:
//!
//! - A mesh relay is reachable only if its npub is a Circle member. Anyone
//!   else's `.fips` URL in a relay list is dropped from the plan.
//! - Our own mesh relay is never a lane: the local relay *is* it.
//! - Internet relays are dropped when "offline only" is on.
//! - An author with no relay list gets the configured relays, and the plan
//!   says so (`missing_authors`, `source: fallback`).
