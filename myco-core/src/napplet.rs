//! Wiring `myco-napplet-runtime` to this device: the relay its manifests live
//! in, the Blossom store its files live in, and the live sessions the WebView
//! talks to.
//!
//! The runtime crate names no relay, no blob store and no WebView — that is
//! what makes it testable with no phone. This module is where those seams meet
//! the real ones, and it is deliberately thin: no verification happens here, no
//! policy is decided here. It resolves, hands the bytes to the runtime, and
//! carries frames.
//!
//! ## One session per window
//!
//! A session is created when a napplet window opens and dropped when it closes.
//! Sessions are keyed by an opaque id handed to the Activity, not by the
//! napplet's identity: the same napplet open in two windows is two sessions
//! with two handshakes, and neither can see the other's.
