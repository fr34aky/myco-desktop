//! A pool of **persistent, bidirectional** WebSocket connections to peers' mesh
//! relays — **one socket per peer**, shared by both propagation planes:
//!
//! - **push** ([`PeerRelayPool::send`]): fan an `["EVENT", …]` frame to a peer
//!   (fire-and-forget) — the multi-hop flood of `docs/design/core/event-gossip.md`.
//! - **pull** ([`PeerRelayPool::request`]): open a `REQ`, collect the peer's
//!   matching events until `EOSE`/`CLOSED`, then close the subscription.
//!
//! A Nostr relay connection is two-way, so there is no reason to hold more than one
//! socket per destination: event fan-out, every REQ + its event replies, and the
//! keepalive all multiplex over the single connection via subscription ids (NIP-01).
//! Over BLE a TCP+WS handshake is several round-trips and concurrent connects
//! contend for the one radio, so a fresh socket per message (or a second socket for
//! pulls) is exactly what we avoid.
//!
//! Each peer gets a long-lived actor task ([`run`]) owning the split socket. It
//! `select!`s over (a) commands from the pool, (b) inbound frames, and (c) a
//! keepalive ping. **The read half is the point.** The previous pool was
//! write-only, so it never noticed a *half-open* connection: after a mesh flap the
//! peer keeps the same identity-derived `fd00::` address, but the pre-flap socket is
//! dead — and a write to a dead-but-not-yet-reset TCP socket *buffers and
//! "succeeds"* for as long as the OS retransmits (minutes on mobile). Fan-out then
//! vanished into a black hole while the mesh looked healthy. Reading the socket
//! surfaces a peer close/error at once, and a ping the peer never answers within one
//! interval catches the silent half-open; either drops the task, and the next
//! command lazily reopens a fresh connection.
