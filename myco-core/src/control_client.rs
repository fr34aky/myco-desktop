//! Client for the fips node's Unix-domain control socket.
//!
//! The node no longer exposes an in-process read handle or a Rust API for
//! pushing platform-discovered peers; both are control-socket commands now
//! (`show_peers`, `connect`). This module is Myco's only way to talk to a node
//! that `run_rx_loop` has borrowed for its whole life.
//!
//! The wire format is fips's own (`docs/reference/control-socket.md`):
//! newline-delimited JSON, one request line per connection, the write half shut
//! down so the server stops waiting for more, one response line back, envelope
//! `{"status":"ok","data":…}` / `{"status":"error","message":…}`. The reference
//! client lives in fips's `src/bin/`, not its library, so it cannot be imported.
//!
//! **Never call this from the FFI thread.** A connect + write + read with a 5s
//! timeout is not a substitute for the lock-free `peer_views()` read it
//! replaces; `AppRuntime::state()` reads a cached snapshot the 8s tick writes.
