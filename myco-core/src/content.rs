//! The Myco content layer: the embedded relay + Blossom stores wired to the
//! `nsite-deck` gateway engine, plus the Library and per-site sync status the FFI
//! surfaces. This is the in-process glue (`myco-core` is the only crate that names
//! a concrete relay/Blossom). The localhost `:4870` / `:24243` sockets and the
//! `:80` external door are **not** bound in P2 — the in-app WebView reaches the
//! gateway in-process via `gateway_get` (the `gatewayGet` JNI). Peer sync over
//! those sockets is P3.
//!
//! Sync is **spawn-not-block**: `open_site` runs on the Tokio runtime and writes
//! status into `sites`; the reducer never blocks on it (Kotlin polls `siteStatus`
//! via `Tick`). See `docs/design/nsite-layer.md` and the FFI contract.
