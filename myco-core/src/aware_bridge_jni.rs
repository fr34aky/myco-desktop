//! Wi-Fi Aware bridge — the JNI side.
//!
//! Unlike the BLE bridge, this is *control-plane only*: there is no byte
//! bridge and no `AndroidRadio` trait to implement. A Wi-Fi Aware data path
//! terminates in a kernel network interface, so the bytes ride an ordinary
//! UDP transport — one of the node's `"aware0"`…`"aware3"` instances, bound at
//! `runtime::AWARE_UDP_BASE_PORT + slot` and pinned by `AwareRadio` to that
//! peer's NDP `android.net.Network`. One socket can be marked for only one
//! network, so the pool is what lets the lane carry more than one peer.
//! The Kotlin `AwareRadio` runs discovery autonomously and only pushes
//! "peer reachable" events into Myco's own bounded queue
//! ([`crate::platform_peers`]), which a tokio task drains onto the node's
//! control socket. The push itself never touches the socket: it arrives on the
//! radio's single `HandlerThread`, which must not be held.
//!
//! Kotlin passes the peer's link-local address already formatted with a
//! *numeric* scope (`"[fe80::x%3]:4871"`, ifindex resolved from
//! `LinkProperties`) — interface-name scopes do not parse (see
//! docs/design/fips/wifi-aware-interop.md § "Dialing a link-local peer").
//!
//! Compiled only on Android; the host build exercises the same seam directly
//! through [`crate::platform_peers`].

/// transport; the Noise IK handshake authenticates — the pushed npub is only
/// a routing hint.
///
/// `lane` is `"udp"` for the LAN/AP radio, or the Aware radio's slot —
/// `"aware0"`…`"aware3"`. Every lane, and every Aware slot within it, is its own
/// UDP transport instance with its own socket, pinned to its own
/// `android.net.Network`, so the address is qualified with that instance's name
/// (`"udp/aware2"`, `"udp/lan"`). fips's `TransportSpec` routes the dial to the
/// matching socket and, crucially, refuses rather than substituting another one
/// — dialing an Aware peer from the Wi-Fi-pinned socket is unroutable and was
/// the reason Aware never carried a handshake, and dialing peer B's NDP from
/// the socket pinned to peer A's is the same fault one layer down.
///
/// The lane is *also* recorded, separately, in [`crate::lane_observation`], for
/// `merge_peers()`'s `lane_by_npub` override — as the family name (`"aware"`),
/// because which radio saw a peer is one fact regardless of which socket
/// carries it. That record is Myco-owned and never reaches fips.
