//! The **mesh relay proxy**: the NIP-01 WebSocket front door serving the in-app
//! WebView at `ws://localhost:4870` and mesh peers at `ws://[fd00::self]:4870`,
//! with a relay store behind it.
//!
//! This is the only Myco-specific code on the content path. It keeps **live
//! subscriptions** (a `REQ` stays open; newly-stored events that match are pushed
//! as they arrive), which is what makes nearby chat feel live, and it drives both
//! mesh planes: a [`Gossiper`] for fan-out (`docs/design/core/event-gossip.md`) and a
//! [`PeerGate`] for access, each keyed off the connection's [`Origin`] (loopback =
//! the local WebView, else a mesh peer).
//!
//! It lives here rather than in `myco-relay` so the store behind it stays a plain
//! NIP-01 relay with no Myco concepts in it, and can be swapped for any other
//! relay later. This is step P1 of `reference/thinning-custom-relay.md`. A proxy
//! built with no gossiper and no gate behaves as an ordinary NIP-01 relay, which
//! is what the tests use.
