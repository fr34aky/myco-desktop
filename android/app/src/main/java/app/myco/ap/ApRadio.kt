/**
 * The LAN lane (born as the `!FIPS` access-point lane). When the phone is on
 * any Wi-Fi — a FIPS AP's open `!FIPS` SSID, or a home network shared with
 * another Myco phone or a desktop — this connects the app's node to the other
 * fips nodes there over the ordinary UDP transport:
 *
 *  1. watch infrastructure Wi-Fi via a [ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback]
 *     (passive, permissionless);
 *  2. while any Wi-Fi is up, browse mDNS for `_fips._udp` — the advert fips
 *     LAN discovery publishes (`reference/fips` `src/discovery/lan`), whose
 *     TXT carries the node's `npub`;
 *  2b. and publish the same advert for ourselves ([startAdvert]), so the
 *     other side finds us too — two phones on one Wi-Fi meet here instead of
 *     over BLE;
 *  3. on resolve, push `(npub, addr)` into the core's platform peer queue
 *     ([NativeCore.awarePeerFound], lane `"udp"`) — the same seam the Wi-Fi
 *     Aware radio uses, labelled with this lane's own name rather than
 *     masquerading as Aware. The core turns that label into the qualified
 *     transport `"udp/lan"`, so the node dials the LAN lane's own UDP socket
 *     (bound `:4871`, pinned below to this Wi-Fi [Network]) and never the
 *     Aware one; Noise IK authenticates, and the pushed npub is only a
 *     routing hint.
 *
 * The browse is deliberately **not** gated on the literal `!FIPS` SSID: on
 * API 33+ the SSID is redacted unless the app holds location permission, so a
 * name gate would kill the lane on modern devices — and browsing another LAN
 * is harmless (nothing advertises there). The SSID is still read best-effort
 * for the Dev panel.
 *
 * Address preference on resolve: link-local IPv6 first (never captured by the
 * mesh TUN, always on-link), then a global/non-ULA IPv6, then IPv4 as a
 * v4-mapped IPv6 (`[::ffff:a.b.c.d]` — the core's UDP socket is a dual-stack
 * `[::]` bind and its transport selection is family-aware, so a plain V4
 * address would find no compatible socket). `fd00::/8` addresses are skipped:
 * the VpnService routes that prefix into the mesh TUN, so dialing one would
 * blackhole the handshake.
 *
 * The `!FIPS` AP never passes internet validation (it's local-only), so on a
 * phone with active mobile data the OS can route the handshake's replies to
 * a competing validated default network instead of back over this Wi-Fi —
 * the send succeeds locally but nothing ever comes back. [UdpSocketPin] pins
 * this lane's own UDP transport socket to this specific [Network] so replies
 * aren't lost that way — and, because that mark is exclusive, so that pinning
 * it here cannot cost the Wi-Fi Aware lane its own reachability.
