/**
 * The Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) bulk-lane radio. Control-plane only: it discovers
 * peers, brings up a data path (NDP), and pushes "peer reachable / lost" into
 * the core ([NativeCore.awarePeerFound]/[NativeCore.awarePeerLost]). The bytes
 * ride a fips UDP transport over the `aware_dataN` interface — this class never
 * touches a payload byte. See docs/design/fips/wifi-aware-interop.md.
 *
 * That transport is **this lane's own** UDP socket, and this class pins it to
 * the NDP's [Network] ([pins]). Both halves matter. An NDP is a network of
 * its own with its own routing table, so a socket marked with any other
 * network — infrastructure Wi-Fi, as the AP lane marks it — cannot reach an
 * Aware peer at all: the address is well-formed, the send reports success, and
 * nothing arrives. That was the whole of the "Aware discovers everything and
 * peers with nothing" fault. See [UdpSocketPin].
 *
 * # One socket per peer, not one per lane
 *
 * That exclusivity does not stop at the lane boundary: each NDP is a separate
 * [Network] too, so one socket cannot serve two peers either — the most recent
 * bind wins and the rest go dark with their data paths still up. The core
 * therefore binds a pool of UDP transport instances (`aware0`…) and this class
 * holds a pin per instance, giving each peer a [slotPool] slot and pinning that
 * slot's socket to that peer's data path. The chipsets always had the headroom
 * (a Pixel 7 Pro advertises 8 concurrent data paths, a Galaxy A52s 2); the
 * single socket was the ceiling. See `reference/aware-multipeer-limit.md`.
 *
 * Flow, per peer:
 *  1. publish + subscribe the Myco service (symmetric, no group owner).
 *  2. on a subscribe match, exchange identities over Aware `sendMessage`
 *     (the analog of BLE's in-band pubkey exchange — no identity is in the
 *     advert itself). The payload is `"<npub>|<port>"`, where the port is the
 *     one *this* peer's slot listens on.
 *  3. the smaller-npub side requests the NDP (the cross-probe tiebreaker,
 *     applied before spending a scarce data-path slot; the core backstops it).
 *  4. read the peer's scoped link-local IPv6 from [WifiAwareNetworkInfo] and
 *     push `awarePeerFound(npub, "[fe80::x%ifindex]:port", "aware<slot>")`.
 *
 * The listener port is **per peer**, not a global constant — and now doubly so.
 * Each side advertises, in the identity exchange, the port of the socket it has
 * pinned to *that* peer's data path (slot *i* listens on
 * [app.myco.core.AppState.wifiAwarePort]` + i`, `runtime.rs`'s
 * `AWARE_UDP_BASE_PORT`), and we dial each peer at the port *it* named.
 * Dialling our own port instead is what broke interop the moment this lane
 * moved off the LAN port: a peer on an older build still listens on
 * [LEGACY_UDP_PORT], so the dial lands on a dead port, the handshake never
 * completes, and Android tears the idle NDP down ~35s later — forever. An
 * identity payload with no port is exactly that peer, and is dialled at
 * [LEGACY_UDP_PORT]; there is no flag day.
 *
 * A peer discovered before its identity is known is told the base port, which
 * is slot 0 — so two phones need no correction at all, and a third only learns
 * its port a message later ([updatePeerPort] re-announces if its data path beat
 * the correction).
 *
 * The NDP is left **open** (no PSK) — fips authenticates with Noise IK.
