/**
 * The Android BLE radio. Kotlin owns the radio; the Rust core (fips `AndroidIo`)
 * drives it through the byte-bridge:
 *
 * - The Rust core calls the control methods here (listen/connect/advertise/scan/
 *   close) via JNI — see [app.myco.core.NativeCore.bleBridgeNew].
 * - This class pushes inbound bytes/events to the core and pulls outbound bytes
 *   via the `NativeCore.ble*` exports.
 *
 * L2CAP CoC over Android's [BluetoothSocket] is a byte **stream** with no relation
 * to FIPS packet boundaries. This radio is a transparent byte pipe: it forwards the
 * exact socket bytes to/from the core, in order and losslessly. The core recovers
 * packet boundaries itself from the 4-byte FMP length-prefixed header (the same
 * framer TCP uses) — see fips `BleStreamRead` / `read_fmp_packet`.
 *
 * The contract: the ordered concatenation of every chunk passed to `deliver_recv`
 * must exactly equal the byte stream the peer sent. Chunking is free; losslessness
 * and order are mandatory. A dropped inbound chunk desyncs the core's reframer for
 * the rest of the connection, so it is **fatal** — see [readerLoop].
