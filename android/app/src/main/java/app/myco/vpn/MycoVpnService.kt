/**
 * The **app-owned TUN**: a [VpnService] that owns the TUN fd and pumps IPv6 packet
 * bytes between it and the FIPS node over the JNI bridge ([NativeCore.tunSendPacket]
 * / [NativeCore.tunNextPacket]). It routes **only `fd00::/8`** (the mesh ULA), so
 * normal internet traffic is untouched — this is not a full-tunnel VPN.
 *
 * The node installs the bridge channels when it starts (BLE on); this service just
 * moves bytes. With it up, a native socket to `[fd00::peer]:4870/:24243` routes
 * over the mesh, so the sync engine can pull a shared nsite from a peer's device.
 *
 * It also advertises the in-mesh sentinel resolver `fd00::53` as the VPN's DNS
 * server and leaves every app on the tunnel (no [Builder.addAllowedApplication]
 * restriction), so **any app** — not just Myco — can resolve `<npub>.fips` names
 * and reach mesh addresses directly. The native TUN pump answers those DNS
 * queries by pure computation (see `myco-core`'s `dns_intercept`); everything
 * else stays off this route, so normal internet is untouched.
 *
 * ### Exit mode
 * Given an [EXTRA_EXIT_PROXY] address, the service also advertises an HTTP proxy
 * to every app on the tunnel, so their web traffic egresses through a proxy
 * running on a mesh **exit node** — letting a phone with no internet of its own
 * browse the public web over the mesh. Android's [ProxyInfo] is unreliable with
 * an IPv6 literal, so the proxy is advertised as `127.0.0.1:<port>` and a small
 * loopback relay ([ExitRelay]) carries those connections to the exit's mesh
 * address. Because the exit is named by npub, `<npub>.fips:8080` works and the
 * exit need not peer this device directly — FIPS forwards multi-hop.
