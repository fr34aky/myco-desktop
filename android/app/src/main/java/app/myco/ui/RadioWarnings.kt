 * On AOSP, `neverForLocation` means the master location switch has nothing to
 * do with BLE scanning from API 31 up. Some vendor stacks ignore that and gate
 * scan callbacks on it anyway. The failure is completely silent — permissions
 * are granted, `startScan` reports success, advertising works and inbound
 * connections land — the device simply never receives a scan result, so it can
 * never learn a peer's PSM and never dials anyone.
 *
 * The test is therefore the *symptom* plus its likely cause, never the setting
 * alone: warning on "location is off" would be a false alarm on every
 * compliant device, which is most of them. [BleHealth.scannerConfirmedSilent]
 * is the symptom — a full minute of listening that produced not one advert —
 * and it clears itself the moment a real advert arrives, which is exactly what
 * happens on this hardware within seconds of location being switched on.
