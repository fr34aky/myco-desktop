 * block per radio lane, each saying whether that lane is looking for anyone and
 * which peers it is currently carrying.
 *
 * Every number here is observed, never inferred: a lane whose scan state the
 * app could not read says "unknown" rather than "idle", and a link MMP has
 * never timed shows no ping rather than `0ms`.
