/**
 * Hosts one napplet: a chrome-less WebView running the **shell**, which in turn
 * runs the napplet in a sandboxed iframe.
 *
 * A separate Activity from [NsiteActivity] on purpose. The two share a look, not
 * a codebase: their intent contracts, request interception, navigation policy,
 * lifecycle and trust boundaries all differ, and merging them would put
 * capability plumbing inside the class that renders untrusted nsite documents.
 * What is genuinely shared is chrome-less task plumbing, and that is
 * [ChromelessChrome] — a helper, not a base class, so nsite semantics cannot
 * arrive here by inheritance.
 *
 * ## What runs where
 *
 * ```text
 *   WebView  ->  the shell page at <label>.napplet.localhost   (ours, trusted)
 *                  └─ iframe sandbox="allow-scripts", srcdoc   (the napplet, untrusted)
 * ```
 *
 * The napplet is never the WebView's top-level document. Loaded that way it
 * would *be* the shell origin — with the shell's storage, inside the origin the
 * capability channel is scoped to. Its only home is the opaque origin the
 * sandboxed iframe gives it.
 *
 * ## The capability channel
 *
 * `addWebMessageListener`, registered against this window's shell origin alone
 * and never a wildcard. The napplet's iframe has an opaque origin, so it matches
 * no rule and never receives the injected object. `addJavascriptInterface` is
 * not used and must not be: its object lands in *every* frame with JavaScript
 * enabled, including the napplet's, which would hand the sandboxed napplet the
 * bridge and make the whole capability seam decorative.
 *
 * Verification, policy and every capability live in Rust. This class is a pipe.
