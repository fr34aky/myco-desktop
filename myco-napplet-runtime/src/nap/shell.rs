//! NAP-SHELL — the bootstrap handshake.
//!
//! Two messages resolve a dependency neither side can break alone: the runtime
//! cannot deliver its capability list until the napplet's receiver is live, and
//! the napplet cannot enumerate capabilities until told.
//!
//! ```text
//! -> { "type": "shell.ready" }
//! <- { "type": "shell.init", "capabilities": { "domains": [ … ] }, "services": [] }
//! ```
//!
//! `shell.supports()` and `shell.services()` are **not** wire messages. The
//! napplet caches the environment from `shell.init` and answers them locally,
//! which is why they are absent here — a `shell.supports` arriving over the
//! wire is an unrecognized type, and [`crate::dispatch`] ignores it silently.
