//! NAP-RELAY — reading and publishing Nostr events on the user's behalf.
//!
//! This is the domain where a napplet acts *as* the user, and the one place the
//! user key is used. The napplet never holds it: it describes an event, the
//! runtime fills in the identity, signs, and publishes. There is no path here
//! that returns key material and none that signs something the runtime did not
//! construct itself.
//!
//! ## What the napplet does not get to choose
//!
//! A publish template arrives from untrusted code, so the runtime owns the
//! fields that decide *who* published and *when*:
//!
//! - **`pubkey`** is always the user key. A napplet naming an author would be
//!   asking the runtime to forge one.
//! - **`created_at`** is always now. Accepting the napplet's would let it
//!   backdate an event into a conversation that has already happened, or
//!   postdate one to sit at the top of a feed indefinitely.
//! - **`id` and `sig`** are computed, never copied.
//!
//! Everything that is genuinely the napplet's message — `kind`, `content`,
//! `tags` — is taken as given. The runtime is a notary, not an editor.
//!
//! ## The grant is per call
//!
//! A `relay` grant covers publishing with no per-event prompt (D8), which means
//! a granted napplet can publish as you at will. That is why the install screen
//! says so in words, and why the grant is checked on every call rather than
//! cached at handshake — revoking it stops the next publish, not the next
//! launch.
//!
//! ## Interim: the kinds that reshape the user are refused
//!
//! Until the permission model has per-event prompts, `sign_template` refuses
//! the kinds that rewrite who the user *is* rather than what they say: kind 0
//! (profile), 3 (contacts), 5 (deletion) and 10000–19999 (the replaceable
//! range, kind 10002 among them). A napplet that could publish a kind 10002
//! under the default grant would make its own relay the user's newest relay
//! list, and every later outbox publish would fan the user's signed events to
//! it. The refusal is per call and surfaces as `ok: false` with the reason on
//! the `.result` frame, never silently. See `REFUSED_KINDS`.
