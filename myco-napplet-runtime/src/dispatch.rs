//! Envelope routing: which NAP handles a message, and whether it may be
//! handled at all.
//!
//! Three refusals live here, and they are deliberately different from each
//! other:
//!
//! - **Unrecognized type — silence.** NIP-5D: "Messages with an unrecognized
//!   `type` MUST be silently ignored." That is what lets a napplet built
//!   against a newer registry run here without erroring on every call to a
//!   domain this build has never heard of. An error reply would also tell a
//!   napplet exactly which domains exist, which is not its business.
//! - **Not yet handshaken — an error.** NAP-SHELL forbids servicing capability
//!   calls before the session is established. The type is recognized, so
//!   silence would look like a lost message.
//! - **Not granted — an error.** Every implemented domain is in the napplet's
//!   namespace whatever it was granted (see `session.rs`), so this is the one
//!   place the permission is enforced. Saying so leaks nothing the napplet
//!   could not learn by trying.
