//! The trait seams the runtime reaches the world through. Nothing in this crate
//! names a concrete relay, blob store, key store, radio, or WebView — which is
//! what keeps every layer above testable off-device, with no phone in the loop.
//!
//! Two seams are not ours: [`RelayBackend`] and [`BlobStore`] come from
//! `nsite-deck`, because a napplet's manifests live in the same relay and its
//! files in the same Blossom store as an nsite's. Re-exported here so a consumer
//! wires one crate rather than two.
//!
//! The rest are napplet-only:
//!
//! - [`Signer`] — the user key, which never leaves Rust. A napplet asks for a
//!   signature; it never sees a key, and there is no seam through which it
//!   could.
//! - [`OutboxResolver`] — which relays an event should reach, across the three
//!   lanes (local, mesh, internet).
//! - [`MeshSink`] — hop-limited publish and pull over the device's mesh,
//!   behind NAP-MESH. The runtime never sees a radio or a peer address; it
//!   hands over an event and a hop budget, and asks for backlog with one.
//! - [`NapTransport`] — the shell ↔ Rust channel. A seam so that dispatch,
//!   policy and capabilities never learn whether they are talking over
//!   `addWebMessageListener`, a `WebMessagePort`, or the desktop harness's
//!   WebSocket.
