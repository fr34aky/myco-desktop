//! The shell page: trusted HTML shipped with the runtime.
//!
//! Served by `NappletActivity`'s own request interception at the per-napplet
//! shell origin, and by nothing else. It is deliberately not updatable over the
//! mesh — it is code, not content, and a napplet that could replace it would be
//! replacing the thing that contains it.
//!
//! It is embedded in the binary rather than shipped as an Android asset so the
//! page and the runtime that speaks to it cannot drift apart: the framing in
//! [`crate::shell_link`] and the JavaScript that writes it are compiled from
//! the same commit.

/// The name the capability channel is injected under, matching the shell page.
///
/// Registered with `addWebMessageListener` against **this window's shell origin
/// alone** — never a wildcard. The napplet's iframe has an opaque origin, so it
/// matches no rule and never receives the object.
