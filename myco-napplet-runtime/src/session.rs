//! One napplet's live session: who it is, what it may use, and whether the

//!
//! The session is the enforcement point. NAP-SHELL puts it plainly: by
//! withholding `shell.init`, a runtime denies a napplet every capability at
//! once. So everything a napplet is allowed to do is decided here, from two
//! inputs it does not control — the identity assigned at creation from verified
//! bytes, and the grants recorded on its library entry at install review.
//!
//! Nothing the napplet says over the wire feeds either one. `shell.ready`
//! carries no payload by design, precisely so there is nothing in it for a
//! runtime to be tricked into trusting.
