//! The shell ↔ Rust link: framing, and the rule that keeps a napplet from
//! impersonating the shell.
//!
//! Two very different conversations share one channel. The shell has its own
//! small control traffic — "I have mounted", "here are the bytes to load" — and
//! it also relays NAP messages to and from the napplet in its iframe. If both
//! travelled untagged, a napplet could send `{"type":"…"}` shaped like shell
//! control traffic and the runtime would act on it.
//!
//! So every frame names its `channel`. The shell is trusted code and tags what
//! it forwards; the runtime believes the tag *only* because the shell, not the
//! napplet, is what writes it — the napplet's own messages arrive at the shell
//! through `postMessage` and are wrapped, never passed through.
//!
//! ```text
//! -> { "channel": "shell",   "action": "mounted" }
//! <- { "channel": "shell",   "action": "load", "artifact": "…", "sandbox": "allow-scripts" }
//! -> { "channel": "napplet", "message": { "type": "shell.ready" } }
//! <- { "channel": "napplet", "message": { "type": "shell.init", … } }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why the artifact travels over the channel
//!
//! The napplet's bytes are pushed to the shell and assigned to `srcdoc`. They
//! are never served at the shell's origin. Serving them there would make them
//! reachable by URL, and anything navigating to that URL would be running the
//! napplet *as* the shell origin — the origin the capability channel is scoped
//! to, with the shell's storage attached. Pushing them keeps the napplet's only
//! home the opaque origin inside the iframe.
