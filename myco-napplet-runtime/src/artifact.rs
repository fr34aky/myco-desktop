//! Assembling the bytes that go into `iframe.srcdoc`.
//!
//! ## The napplet always runs in an iframe
//!
//! Never as the WebView's top-level document. The WebView loads the **shell** —
//! Myco's own trusted page, shipped in the APK — and the shell creates a
//! `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe whose `srcdoc` is what this module builds.
//! NIP-5D requires exactly this, and requires that `allow-same-origin` is never
//! among the tokens.
//!
//! The isolation comes from that nesting. `srcdoc` without `allow-same-origin`
//! gives the napplet an **opaque origin**: no `localStorage`, no `IndexedDB`, no
//! cookies, no reach into the shell's DOM, and no way to read anything belonging
//! to the shell's origin or to another napplet. Load the same bytes as the
//! WebView's top-level document instead and every one of those protections is
//! gone — the napplet would *be* the shell origin, inherit its storage, and (on
//! device) sit inside the origin the capability channel is scoped to.
//!
//! That is why [`assemble`] returns a [`SrcdocArtifact`] rather than a `String`:
//! the type says where the bytes are allowed to go.
//!
//! Two things have to reach the napplet's document that are **not** the
//! napplet's own bytes: a Content-Security-Policy, and the `window.napplet`
//! prelude. Both are injected here, after verification, and neither is part of
//! the aggregate — NIP-5D is explicit that the injected policy "MUST remain
//! outside the bytes used to compute `aggregateHash`, just like the injected
//! `window.napplet` namespace". Assembling *after* the hash check is what keeps
//! that true by construction: [`crate::resolve`] hands over verified bytes and
//! nothing here feeds back into identity.
//!
//! ## Why a `meta` and not a header
//!
//! A `srcdoc` document has no HTTP response to carry a CSP header on, so the
//! policy has to be a `<meta http-equiv>` — and it only governs what is parsed
//! *after* it. NIP-5D therefore requires it be the first element in `head`,
//! before any napplet-controlled resource or script.
//!
//! ## Why the injection point is position zero
//!
//! The obvious implementation searches the document for `<head>` and inserts
//! after it. That hands the placement decision to attacker-controlled text: a
//! napplet that opens with `<!-- <head> -->` gets our policy injected into a
//! comment, and silently loses CSP entirely while appearing to have it.
//!
//! So nothing is searched for. The document is rebuilt as
//!
//! ```text
//! <!doctype html> <meta CSP> <script prelude> <the napplet's bytes>
//! ```
//!
//! and the HTML parser does the rest: a `<meta>` before `<html>` is placed by
//! the "before html" / "before head" insertion modes as the first child of a
//! head the parser creates. The only text inspected is the very start of the
//! document, to drop a doctype the napplet declared itself — a position no
//! comment can move.
