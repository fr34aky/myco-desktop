//! The `window.napplet` prelude: the capability namespace a napplet calls
//! through.
//!
//! NIP-5D requires the namespace exist before any napplet script runs, and the
//! shell cannot script into an opaque origin from outside — so the prelude
//! rides into the `srcdoc` bytes alongside the CSP, injected by
//! [`crate::artifact`] after verification and outside the aggregate.
//!
//! The prelude itself is upstream's, vendored verbatim (see
//! `assets/vendor/README.md`). Upstream owns the domain surface, so tracking
//! their build keeps Myco's `window.napplet.*` identical to every other
//! conformant runtime's; hand-writing one would mean re-deriving their
//! interface on every registry change.
//!
//! Two things the vendored build does not carry are supplied by Myco's own
//! supplement (`assets/myco-prelude.js`), installed right after it: the
//! napplet-side half of NAP-SHELL (`shell.supports()` and `shell.services`,
//! which the vendored shim has no `shell` domain for), and NAP-MESH, which the
//! vendored installer filters out because it is not in the upstream registry.
//! The supplement takes the same domain list, so the two cannot disagree.
//!
//! ## Every API is injected, always
//!
//! [`render`] installs everything this build implements, regardless of what the
//! user granted. The permission lives *behind* the call: `window.napplet.relay`
//! exists for every napplet, and a napplet without a `relay` grant gets a
//! refusal when it publishes, not a missing object when it looks.
//!
//! The difference matters to the napplet's own logic. An absent namespace entry
//! reads as "this runtime cannot do relay", which is permanent and sends the
//! napplet down its fallback path for good. A refused call reads as "not right
//! now", which it can surface, retry, or ask about — and which stays true when
//! the user changes their mind later without the napplet reloading.
//!
//! Enforcement is [`crate::dispatch`], which refuses ungranted domains whatever
//! the namespace contains — a napplet can always `postMessage` directly, so the
//! namespace was never the boundary.

/// runtime posts it from its own injected namespace for the same reason.

/// refused with "session not established" — long after the napplet believes it
/// started up, and with no message visible to say what is missing.

/// It goes **after** `install`, not before: `shell.ready` means "my receiver is
/// live", and the receiver is what `install` puts in place. Sent first, the
/// runtime would answer `shell.init` into a napplet that is not listening yet,
/// and the environment would be lost.
///
/// A duplicate is harmless — NAP-SHELL requires a second `shell.ready` be
