# Vendored third-party assets

Code that is **not ours**, checked in verbatim so the APK ships a fixed,
reviewable artifact rather than resolving a package at build time.

## `napplet-shim-prelude.global.js`

The `window.napplet` prelude — the capability namespace NIP-5D requires be
installed before any napplet script runs. Injected into each napplet's
`srcdoc` by `crate::artifact`, because the shell cannot script into an
opaque origin from outside.

Upstream owns the domain surface (`window.napplet.relay`,
`window.napplet.identity`, …), so tracking their build keeps Myco's namespace
identical to every other conformant runtime's. Hand-writing a shim would mean
re-deriving their interface on every registry change.

It exposes one global, `NappletShimPrelude`, whose `install({ domains })`
takes an explicit allowlist and installs **only** the requested domains. Myco
passes every domain this build **implements**, granted or not: the namespace
and `shell.supports()` describe the runtime, and the permission is enforced
per call in `dispatch.rs`, where a refusal is one failed action rather than a
missing object the napplet reads as "this runtime cannot".

### Updating

```sh
npm pack @napplet/shim@<version>
tar xzf napplet-shim-<version>.tgz
cp package/dist/prelude.global.js \
   myco-napplet-runtime/assets/vendor/napplet-shim-prelude.global.js
```

Then update the version, sha256 and date above, and re-run the crate's tests —
they assert the global name and the install signature this runtime depends on.
Per D7 the NAP revision is pinned deliberately, so bumping this is a decision,
not a chore.
