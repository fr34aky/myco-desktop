# Myco v0.7.0

**Released**: 2026-09-16

v0.7.0 is three releases in one. Myco turns from an nsite viewer into an app
runtime: alongside nsites it runs **napplets** — single-file programs published
on Nostr — each in its own sandbox, with the capabilities it uses granted by
you. You can **send a file to a friend's phone** from any app, encrypted over
the mesh, no hotspot and no internet. And **peers stay connected**: the mesh now
holds every link it has to a phone and switches between them, which on real
phones in a real room is the difference between a peer that flickers and one
that stays.

**No wire-format change from v0.6.x.** A v0.7.0 phone and a v0.6.1 phone still
exchange apps and messages and pair. The new multi-path link messages are
ignored by an older phone, which keeps linking over a single path as before.
Everything on the device upgrades in place; the event store is migrated on
first open.

## At a glance

- **Peers stay connected.** A phone next to you is usually reachable more than
  one way; Myco now keeps every path, probes the spares, and moves traffic when
  the active one degrades instead of dropping the peer and finding it again
  from scratch. Built on fips's multi-path branch. The status panel shows each
  link, the active one lit.
- **Send a file.** Share anything from another app, pick a paired phone, and it
  arrives encrypted over the mesh — or tap a contact on the Circle tab. The
  other phone is asked first; the file lands in Downloads/Myco. Two phones on
  the same Wi-Fi move it in seconds rather than minutes.
- **Napplets.** Add one by pasting an `naddr`, scanning a QR, or bumping a
  friend's phone — the friend's phone is asked first, so it arrives with no
  internet. Review what it asks for, and it lands on the Apps grid with a 🦆
  badge and its own full-screen window. Discover suggests three to start with,
  and DingDong comes preinstalled.
- **Permissions you can see and change.** The install sheet lists everything a
  napplet will be able to do before you agree. Hold a tile → Manage permissions
  to switch each capability off or on; a change is live. An update that asks for
  more than you were shown goes back through the sheet first.
- **Same-Wi-Fi discovery has a switch,** and peers that dropped off the network
  come back on their own.
- **A crashed page cannot take Myco down.** A window whose renderer dies closes
  on its own; the mesh, the relay and your other windows keep running.

## Napplets

An nsite is a website Myco serves from the mesh. A napplet is a program: one
HTML file, signed by its author, that asks the phone running it for things —
who you are, what your relays hold, what is on the phones around you, a picture
by its hash. NIP-5D defines the shape; Myco implements the runtime.

Each napplet runs in a sandboxed frame inside a trusted page Myco ships. It has
no network of its own: no fetch, no WebSocket, no storage. Everything it does
goes through a message channel to Myco, which checks the request against what
you granted and does the work on the napplet's behalf. This release implements
five capability families, in the words the install sheet uses:

- **Identity** — a user key, separate from the mesh device key, created the first
  time a napplet opens. Napplets learn who you are socially; the device is never
  named in anything signed by that key.
- **Relays** — read and post as you on the relay pool: this phone's relay and the
  public relays when reachable. Posting excludes your profile, contacts, relay
  list and deletions for now; a napplet that tries gets a refusal, not a silent
  drop.
- **Outbox** — an author's notes from the relays they publish to, whether that is
  a phone across the room or a public relay, with an honest `incomplete` when a
  relay never answered.
- **Mesh** — Myco's own: publish to everyone nearby with a chosen hop count and
  pull what was missed. Settings › App reach caps how far apps may send and look.
- **Pictures and files** — by content hash: this phone first, then a friend's
  phone over the mesh, then the public servers. What is fetched is kept for the
  next app and the next phone in the room.

Versions are pinned to bytes: the napplet you open is always the one whose file
is on your phone, and a newer manifest with nothing behind it cannot take an
app off the air. "Check for updates" refreshes napplets beside the nsite check.

## Send a file

Share a photo, a document, anything, from any app on the phone: Myco appears in
the system Sharesheet, you pick one of your paired phones, and the file goes
out over the mesh — encrypted to that phone's key, over whichever path reaches
it, with no hotspot and no internet. The Circle tab has the same door: tap a
contact and choose **Send a file**.

The receiving phone is asked before anything is transferred and can say no. A
transfer in flight shows on the Circle tab beside pairing requests, so a send
that is still waiting is visible from anywhere in the app and can be cancelled;
an offer nobody answers gives up after ten minutes. Received files land in
Downloads/Myco.

Two phones on the same Wi-Fi now find each other over the network rather than
Bluetooth — Myco announces itself on the local network the way a fips node
does — and a file that took minutes over Bluetooth takes seconds over UDP.
Bluetooth still works when there is no shared network; it is just slower.

A transfer survives a flaky link. If a control message — the offer, the accept,
the "ready" — is lost while Bluetooth is re-dialling, each side keeps re-sending
what it is waiting to hear until the transfer moves on, and a large file over a
slow hop is only given up when nothing has arrived for thirty seconds, not on a
fixed clock.

## The mesh holds more than one link

This is the change that matters most in a room. A phone next to you is usually
reachable more than one way — Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Aware, or Bluetooth and the
local network. Until now Myco used one and forgot the other, and when that one
failed the peer was gone until it was found again from scratch: a Bluetooth
hiccup, a Wi-Fi Aware teardown, a phone walking behind a wall, each one a
disconnect and a re-discovery.

The mesh now keeps every path to a peer, probes the standbys so they are known
to work before they are needed, and switches when the active one degrades. Two
connected phones stay connected through the hiccups that used to drop them,
without re-pairing or re-discovering. In testing on real phones this is the
largest single reliability gain Myco has had; the peers pill stops flickering.

The status panel shows it directly: one icon per lane, the lit one carrying
traffic, the standbys faded. A phone on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at once is listed
under both, and peers that never told us a name are shown by their shortened
npub instead of a placeholder.

This is the first release built on fips's `feat/multi-path-switchover` branch,
which is experimental upstream. The link messages it adds are ignored by older
nodes, so mixed rooms keep working; the multi-path link itself only forms
between two v0.7.0 phones.

## Storage

The relay Myco keeps inside the app is now an LMDB database. Queries are
indexed, writes are one small transaction per event, and the store is ready for
the mesh sync that comes next. Chat and other expiring messages stay in memory
and never touch disk, as before. A store from an earlier version is migrated on
first open; if any event fails to migrate, the old file is kept and nothing is
lost.

## Known issues

- **A phone in your pocket finds nobody.** Myco winds its radios down when it is
  not on screen, so two idle phones in a room will not discover each other until
  one is opened.
- **Wi-Fi Aware is shut off entirely by deep Doze** on Android 13 and later after
  a long idle period —
  [#30](https://github.com/Origami74/myco/issues/30).
- **A napplet's relay access is all-or-nothing.** The `relay` grant lets a napplet
  read everything your relay holds, including what other napplets stored. A
  finer permission model is next on the roadmap.
- **A napplet may name its own relays.** With the outbox grant it can ask Myco to
  talk to a relay it chooses; that is by the specification, and it is an
  exfiltration channel. Review the install sheet.
- **Napplets do not replicate over the mesh yet.** A friend's phone can hand you
  one at install time; keeping them in sync afterwards is roadmap.
- Phones still do not always connect to every peer around them.
- The interface can lag while the mesh is syncing.
- Exit-node mode still covers proxy-aware apps only; other apps and QUIC/UDP
  traffic keep using the phone's normal connection.

## Getting it

- **Android**: install the APK from the
  [v0.7.0 release](https://github.com/Origami74/myco/releases/tag/v0.7.0),
  or via [zapstore](https://zapstore.dev/apps/app.myco).
- **From source**: `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug` from a checkout of
  the v0.7.0 tag, with fips on its `feat/multi-path-switchover` branch. See
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Origami74/myco/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  for build prerequisites.

Phones do not need updating together, but the multi-path link only forms
between two phones on v0.7.0.

## Contributors

Thanks to the napplet authors whose apps were the test bed — Mapplets found
two runtime gaps on the first run — and to
[@Origami74](https://github.com/Origami74) for maintaining the project.

This file is published verbatim as the GitHub Release body by
.github/workflows/release.yml — the leading `# Myco vX.Y.Z` heading and
`**Released**:` line are stripped, and the auto-generated "What's Changed"
section is appended below. Two consequences when writing the next one:
  1. Keep the version in the H1 matching the tag, or the workflow falls back
     to generated notes rather than publishing stale text.
  2. Use absolute links — relative paths 404 on a release page.
